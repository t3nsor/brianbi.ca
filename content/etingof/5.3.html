<p><span class="problem">Remark</span> The proof of Proposition 5.3.2 uses the
fact that every finite ring extension is integral. This was not obvious to me
(although I am sure it is obvious to some more sophisticated readers). For the
benefit of the similarly situated, a proof of this fact can be found
<a href="https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/00GH">here</a>.</p>
