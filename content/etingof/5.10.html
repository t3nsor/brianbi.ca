<p><span class="problem">Problem 5.10.2(a)</span> We will use the universal
property for the tensor product of bimodules, which is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>Suppose \(M\) and \(N\) are respectively \((A, B)\)- and
\((B, C)\)-bimodules. If \(P\) is an \((A, C)\)-bimodule, then a map
\(f : M \times N \to P\) is said to be <em>balanced</em> if all of the
following hold:
<ul>
<li>\(f(m_1 + m_2, n) = f(m_1, n) + f(m_2, n)\) for all \(m_1, m_2 \in M\) and
\(n \in N\);</li>
<li>\(f(m, n_1 + n_2) = f(m, n_1) + f(m, n_2)\) for all \(m \in M\) and
\(n_1, n_2 \in N\);</li>
<li>\(f(am, n) = af(m, n)\) for all \(m \in M, n \in N, a \in A\);</li>
<li>\(f(mb, n) = f(m, bn)\) for all \(m \in M, n \in N, b \in B\); and</li>
<li>\(f(m, nc) = f(m, n)c\) for all \(m \in M, n \in N, c \in C\)</li>
</ul>
The tensor product is defined as an \((A, C)\)-bimodule \(M \otimes_B N\)
together with a balanced map \(\otimes : M \times N \to M \otimes_B N\)
such that for every \((A, C)\)-bimodule \(P\) and every balanced map
\(f : M \times N \to P\), there is a unique \((A,C)\)-bimodule homomorphism
\(\tilde{f} : M \otimes_B N \to P\) such that \(f = \tilde{f} \circ
\otimes\).</blockquote>
<p>The above universal property is easily proven to hold for the tensor product
as defined in Problem 2.11.6, and a simple argument similar to
<a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/q/794448/24692">the one for modules</a>
establishes that it uniquely characterizes the tensor product up to
isomorphism.</p>
<p>Now consider the \((k[H], k)\)-bimodule (that is, left \(k[H]\)-module)
\(\Res^G_H V\) together with the
binary operation \(\star : k[G] \times V \to \Res^G_H V\) given by \(a \star v
= av\). It's easy to see that \(\star\) is balanced. Let \(f : k[G] \times V
\to P\) be a balanced map and \(P\) a left \(k[H]\)-module. We claim that there
is precisely one left \(k[H]\)-module homomorphism \(\tilde{f} :
\Res^G_H V \to P\) such that \(f = \tilde{f} \circ \star\). In particular, we
must have \(f(1, v) = \tilde{f}(1 \star v)\) for all \(v \in V\), that is,
\(\tilde{f}(v) = f(1, v)\). With this definition of \(\tilde{f}\), we obtain
\((\tilde{f} \circ \star)(a, v) = \tilde{f}(av) = f(1, av) = f(a, v)\), as
required, and it is easy to check that \(\tilde{f}\) is an isomorphism of
left \(k[H]\)-modules. Since \(\Res^G_H V\) satisfies the universal property,
it is isomorphic to \(k[G] \otimes_{k[G]} V\) as a left \(k[H]\)-module.</p>

<p><span class="problem">Problem 5.10.2(b)</span> It is fairly clear why Remark
5.8.2 is true, so we won't bother to prove it here. By Remark 5.8.2, and
functoriality of \(\Hom(V, -)\) (<i>i.e.</i>, it preserves isomorphisms), we
have
\[
\Hom_G(V, \Ind^G_H W) \cong \Hom_{k[G]}(V, \Hom_{k[H]}(k[G], W))
\]
as \(k\)-vector spaces. By the tensor-hom adjunction
(<a href="/etingof/2.11">Problem 2.11.6(b)</a>), using
the fact that \(V\) is a \((k[G], k)\)-bimodule, \(k[G]\) is a
\((k[H], k[G])\)-bimodule, and \(W\) is a \((k[H], k)\)-bimodule, we have
\[
\Hom_{k[G]}(V, \Hom_{k[H]}(k[G], W)) \cong \Hom_{k[H]}(k[G] \otimes_{k[G]} V, W)
\]
as \((k, k)\)-bimodules, that is, as \(k\)-vector spaces. By part (a) of this
problem and functoriality of \(\Hom(-, W)\), we have
\[
\Hom_{k[H]}(k[G] \otimes_{k[G]} V, W) \cong \Hom_H(\Res^G_H V, W)
\]
as \(k\)-vector spaces. Putting it all together, we conclude
\(\Hom_G(V, \Ind^G_H W) \cong \Hom_H(\Res^G_H V, W)\) as \(k\)-vector
spaces.</p>
<div class="qed"></div>

<p><span class="problem">Problem 5.10.2(c)</span> We'll show that
\(\Hom_{k[G]}(k[G], V) \cong k[G] \otimes_{k[G]} V\) as left \(k[G]\)-modules
using the universal property of the tensor product. The desired result will
immediately follow.</p>
<p>Define \(\star :
k[G] \times V \to \Hom_{k[G]}(k[G], V)\) by \((a \star v)(b) = bav\). Then
\(\star\) is a balanced product of the \((k[G], k[G])\)-bimodule \(k[G]\) and
the left \(k[G]\)-module \(V\).</p>
<p>Let \(f : k[G] \times V \to P\) be a balanced
map where \(P\) is a left \(k[G]\)-module. We claim that there is exactly one
left \(k[G]\)-module homomorphism \(\tilde{f} : \Hom_{k[G]}(k[G], V) \to P\)
such that \(f = \tilde{f} \circ \star\). In particular, every
\(\varphi : \Hom_{k[G]}(k[G], V)\) takes the form \(\varphi(a) =
\varphi(a \cdot 1) = a\varphi(1)\), and there is precisely one such map for
each possible value of \(\varphi(1)\); call this map \(\varphi_v\), so that
\(\varphi_v(a) = av\). Observe that for each \(v \in V\), we have
\(f(1, v) = \tilde{f}(1 \star v) = \tilde{f}(\varphi_v)\). Thus, we must have
\(\tilde{f}(\varphi) = f(1, \varphi(1))\) for each \(\varphi \in
\Hom_{k[G]}(k[G], V)\).</p>
<p>Indeed, for each \(a \in k[G]\),
\(\tilde{f}(a \star v) = \tilde{f}(b \mapsto bav) = \tilde{f}(\varphi_{av})
= f(1, av) = f(a, v)\), so \(\tilde{f} \circ \star = f\) as required.</p>
<div class="qed"></div>

<p><span class="problem">Problem 5.10.2(d)</span> We'll show that
\(\Ind^G_H W\) satisfies the universal property of the tensor product
\(k[G] \otimes_{k[H]} W\) (where \(k[G]\) is a \((k[G], k[H])\)-bimodule and
\(W\) is a left \(k[H]\)-module).</p>
<p>We must define a balanced map \(\star : k[G] \times W \to \Ind^G_H W\).
Intuitively, we want something similar to <q>\(a \star w =
(g \mapsto gaw)\)</q>, which doesn't make sense since we haven't defined an
action of \(k[G]\) on \(W\) yet. However, we can construct one by treating
\(k[G]\) as a direct sum of \(|G|/|H|\) copies of \(k[H]\) and having only one
copy (<i>i.e.,</i> the one naturally embedded in \(k[G]\)) act on \(W\). That
is,
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:star1}
(a \star w)(g) = \pi(ga)w
\end{equation}
where \(\pi : k[G] \to k[H]\) is the \(k\)-linear map such that
\(\pi(g)\) is \(g\) if \(g \in H\), and 0 otherwise. Observe that for all
\(h \in H, a \in k[G]\), we have \(\pi(ha) = h\pi(a)\).</p>
<p>Let \(g \in G, h \in H\); then \((a \star w)(hg) = \pi(hga)w =
h\pi(ga)w = h(a \star w)(g)\). This shows that \(a \star w \in
\Ind^G_H W\).</p>
<p>Linearity of \(\pi\) implies that \(\star\) satisfies the first two
properties of a balanced product, as stated in 5.10.2(a). If \(a_1, a_2 \in
k[G], w \in W, g \in G\), then \(((a_1 a_2)\star w)(g) = \pi(ga_1 a_2)w =
(a_2 \star w)(ga_1) =
(a_1 (a_2 \star w))(g)\). If \(a \in k[G], b \in k[H], w \in W, g \in G\), 
then \(((ab)\star w)(g) = \pi(gab)w = (\pi(ga)b)w = \pi(ga)(bw) =
(a \star (bw))(g)\). Finally, the last property of balanced products in this
case is just \(k\)-linearity, which obviously holds. Therefore
\(\star\) is a balanced product of a \((k[G], k[H])\)-bimodule and a left
\(k[H]\)-module.</p>
<p>In general, \(\im \star\) is not the entire set \(\Ind^G_H W\). However,
observe that if \(g \in G, w \in W\), then \((g^{-1} \star w)(g') =
\pi(g'g^{-1})w\), therefore
\begin{equation*}
(g^{-1} \star w)(g') = \begin{cases}
g'g^{-1} w &amp; \text{if $g, g'$ belong to the same right $H$-coset} \\
0 &amp; \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{equation*}
and in particular \((g^{-1} \star w)(g) = w\). Thus, if \(S\) is a right
\(H\)-transversal of \(G\), <i>i.e.,</i> \(S = \{g_1, g_2, \ldots,
g_{|G|/|H|}\}\) with one element chosen from each \(H\)-coset of \(G\), then
for each \(v \in \Ind^G_H W\), we can write
\begin{equation*}
v = \sum_{g \in S} g^{-1} \star v(g)
\end{equation*}
that is, elements of the form \(g^{-1} \star w\), where \(g \in S\) and
\(w \in W\), span \(\Ind^G_H W\).</p>
<p>Now let \(f : k[G] \times W \to P\) be a balanced product of a
\((k[G], k[H])\)-bimodule and a left \(k[H]\)-module. We claim that there is
exactly one left \(k[G]\)-module homomorphism \(\tilde{f} :
\Ind^G_H W \to P\) such that \(f = \tilde{f} \circ \star\). In particular,
for all \(g \in G, w \in W\), we have \(f(g, w) = \tilde{f}(g \star w)\), which
fixes the value of \(\tilde{f}\) at each element of \(\Ind^G_H W\) of the form
\(g \star w\); we have already established that such elements span
\(\Ind^G_H W\), so there can be at most one possible \(\tilde{f}\). Indeed,
fix some right transversal \(S\) as above and set
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:tildef1}
\tilde{f}(v) = \sum_{g \in S} f(g^{-1}, v(g))
\end{equation}
Since \(f\) is a balanced product, \eqref{eqn:tildef1} doesn't depend on the
choice of transversal. Observe that \(\tilde{f}\) so defined is
\(k\)-linear and for each \(g' \in G\), we have
\begin{align*}
\tilde{f}(g'v)
&amp;= \sum_{g \in S} f(g^{-1}, (g'v)(g)) \\
&amp;= \sum_{g \in S} f(g^{-1}, v(gg')) \\
&amp;= \sum_{g \in S} f(g'(gg')^{-1}, v(gg')) \\
&amp;= g' \sum_{g \in S} f((gg')^{-1}, v(gg')) \\
&amp;= g' \tilde{f}(v)
\end{align*}
where we have used the fact that \(\{gg' \mid g \in S\}\) is also a right
\(H\)-transversal of \(G\). It is thereby established that \(\tilde{f}\) is a
left \(k[G]\)-module homomorphism. We also have that for each \(g \in S,
w \in W\),
\begin{align*}
\tilde{f}(g^{-1} \star w)
&amp;= \sum_{g' \in S} f(g'^{-1}, (g^{-1} \star w)(g')) \\
&amp;= f(g^{-1}, w)
\end{align*}
where we have used the fact that for \(g, g' \in S\), \((g^{-1} \star w)(g')\)
is nonzero only when \(g = g'\). We see that \(\tilde{f} \circ \star\) agrees
with \(f\) on \(S^{-1} \times W\). As we previously discussed, elements of the
form \(g^{-1} \star w\) span \(\Ind^G_H W\), so by linearity,
\(f = \tilde{f} \circ \star\) as required.</p>
<p>(Note: We have used the fact that \eqref{eqn:tildef1} is independent of the
choice of transversal \(S\) in the proof of the universal property. However,
the <em>definition</em> of \(\star\), which establishes the isomorphism
between \(\Ind^G_H W\) and \(k[G] \otimes_{k[H]} W\), was given as
\eqref{eqn:star1} and doesn't make any reference to \(S\). Therefore, said
isomorphism is natural in the informal sense.)</p>
<div class="qed"></div>

<p><span class="problem">Problem 5.10.2(e)</span> Using (c) and (d) together
with the tensor-hom adjunction, we find:
\begin{equation*}
\Hom_H(W, \Res^G_H V) \cong \Hom_H(W, \Hom_{k[G]}(k[G], V))
\cong \Hom_{k[G]}(k[G] \otimes_{k[H]} W, V) \cong \Hom_G(\Ind^G_H W, V)
\end{equation*}
This isomorphism of \(k\)-vector spaces is natural because each of the three
isomorphisms in the above chain is natural.</p>
<div class="qed"></div>

<p><span class="problem">Problem 5.10.2(f)</span> We follow the Hint. By
part (d), \((\Ind^G_H V)^* \cong (k[G] \otimes_{k[H]} V)^\star\). By
Remark 5.8.2, \(\Ind^G_H(V^*) \cong \Hom_H(k[G], V^*)\). Define a
\(k\)-bilinear functional
\(\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle : \Hom_H(k[G], V^*) \times
(k[G] \otimes_{k[H]} V) \to k\) by setting
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:form1}
\langle f, x \otimes_{k[H]} v \rangle = f(Sx)(v)
\end{equation}
for all \(f \in \Hom_H(k[G], V^*), x \in k[G], v \in V\) and extending by
linearity. (Note that the text incorrectly stated the intended domain of the
bilinear form, but it's clear enough from the hint what the correct domain is.)
It's not obvious that this is well-defined, so we now show that this is the
case. Fix \(f \in \Hom_H(k[G], V^*)\); then define \(B_f : k[G] \times V \to
k\) by \(B_f(x, v) = f(Sx)(v)\). It's obvious that \(B_f\) is \(k\)-bilinear;
furthermore, for each \(h \in H\), we have \(B_f(xh, v) = f(S(xh))(v) =
f(h^{-1}Sx)(v) = (h^{-1}f(Sx))(v) = f(Sx)(hv) = B_f(x, hv)\). Thus,
\(B_f\) is a balanced map from a right \(k[H]\)-module and a left
\(k[H]\)-module to \(k\). By the universal property, there is one unique
\(k\)-linear map \(\tilde{B}_f : k[G] \otimes_{k[H]} V \to k\) such that
\(B_f = \tilde{B}_f \circ \otimes_{k[H]}\). Finally, define
\(\langle f, \cdot \rangle = \tilde{B}_f\). It can be easily seen that this
agrees with \eqref{eqn:form1} and the mapping \(f \mapsto \tilde{B}_f\) is
linear.</p>
<p>Suppose \(f \in \Hom_H(k[G], V^*)\) satisfies \(\tilde{B}_f = 0\). Then
\(f(Sx)(v) = 0\) for all \(x \in k[G], v \in V\). This implies
\(f(Sx) = 0\) for all \(x \in k[G]\), so \(f(g^{-1}) = 0\) for all \(g \in G\).
By linearity, \(f\) vanishes identically. This establishes that the mapping
\(\varphi : \Hom_H(k[G], V^*) \to (k[G] \otimes_{k[H]} V)^*\) given by
\(\varphi(f) = \langle f, \cdot \rangle\) is an injection from
\(\Hom_H(k[G], V^*)\) to \((k[G] \otimes_{k[H]} V)^*\); that is, from
\(\Ind^G_H(V^*)\) to \((\Ind^G_H V)^*\). Since \(\dim \Ind^G_H(V^*) =
|G| \dim(V^*)/|H| = |G| \dim(V)/|H| = \dim(\Ind^G_H V) =
\dim((\Ind^G_H V)^*)\), \(\varphi\) is in fact an isomorphism.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we always have \(\langle gf, g(x \otimes_{k[H]}v) \rangle =
\langle gf, gx \otimes_{k[H]}v \rangle = (gf)(S(gx))(v) = f((Sx)g^{-1}g)(v)
= f(Sx)(v) = \langle f, x \otimes_{k[H]} v\rangle\), for each \(g \in G\). By
linearity in the second
argument, we can conclude that \(\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle\) is
\(G\)-invariant. Thus, \(\varphi(gf) =
(t \mapsto \langle gf, t\rangle) = (t \mapsto \langle f, g^{-1}t\rangle) =
g(t \mapsto \langle f, t\rangle) = g\varphi(f)\), so, in fact,
\(\Ind^G_H(V^*) \cong (\Ind^G_H V)^*\) as left \(k[G]\)-modules.</p>
