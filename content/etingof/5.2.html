<li><p>As hinted, we consider the representations of \(G\) over the field
\(\overline{\mathbb{Q}}\). Since this field is algebraically closed, its
representations are characterized by Proposition 3.5.8 (together with Maschke's
theorem). In particular, \(|G| = \sum_i (\dim V_i)^2\) where \(V_i\) ranges
over the irreducible representations. Every irreducible representation over
\(\overline{\mathbb{Q}}\) corresponds to a representation over \(\mathbb{C}\)
in an obvious way. The proof of Theorem 4.5.1 shows that it applies to any
algebraically closed field whose characteristic doesn't divide the order of the
group, so in particular \(\langle V, V \rangle = 1\) for the irreps of \(G\)
over \(\overline{\mathbb{Q}}\); this obviously holds in \(\mathbb{C}\) as well,
so the \(V_i\) are irreducible there also. Since the sum-of-squares relation
also holds in \(\mathbb{C}\), these representations are all the irreducible
representations of \(G\) over \(\mathbb{C}\); that is, every irrep of \(G\)
over \(\mathbb{C}\) can be presented so that its matrices have only algebraic
entries. Choose arbitrary bases \(B_i = \{b_{ij}\}_{j=1}^{\dim V_i}\) for the
\(V_i\)'s considered as representations over \(\overline{\mathbb{Q}}\), and
let \(K\) be the smallest Galois extension of \(\mathbb{Q}\) that contains
the entries of all matrices of all the group elements in the representations
\(V_i\) with respect to the bases \(B_i\). Again by Maschke's theorem and
Proposition 3.5.8, all finite-dimensional complex representations of \(G\)
decompose as a direct sum of the \(V_i\)'s. By choosing a basis for such a
representation in the obvious way from the decomposition into irreducibles and
the \(B_i\)'s previously chosen, we see that all matrix entries belong to the
field \(K\), as desired.</p></li>
<li><p>Again, we follow the hint. Assume \(\chi_V(g) \ne 0\) for all
\(g \in G\). Then \(|\chi_V(g)|^2 &gt; 0\) for all \(g \in G\). By
orthonormality of irreducible characters, \(\sum_{g \in G} |\chi_V(g)|^2 =
|G|\). Now \(|\chi_V(1)|^2 = (\dim V)^2 &gt; 1\), so \(\sum_{g \in
G \setminus \{1\}} |\chi_V(g)|^2 &lt; |G| - 1\). Thus, the arithmetic mean of
the numbers \(|\chi_V(g)|^2\) for \(g \ne 1\) is strictly less than 1. By the
inequality of means, \(\left(\prod_{g \in G \setminus \{1\}}
|\chi_V(g)|^2\right)^{1/(|G| - 1)} &lt; 1\). Since all
\(|\chi_V(g)|^2 &gt; 0\), we must in fact have \(0 &lt;
\prod_{g \in G \setminus \{1\}} |\chi_V(g)|^2 &lt; 1\).</p>
<p>Now observe that:
\begin{align*}
\prod_{g \in G \setminus \{1\}} |\chi_V(g)|^2
&amp;= \prod_{g \in G \setminus \{1\}} \chi_V(g) \overline{\chi_V(g)} \\
&amp;= \prod_{g \in G \setminus \{1\}} \chi_V(g) \chi_V(g^{-1}) \\
&amp;= \prod_{g \in G \setminus \{1\}} \chi_V(g)
\prod_{g \in G \setminus \{1\}} \chi_V(g^{-1}) \\
&amp;= \left[\prod_{g \in G \setminus \{1\}} \chi_V(g)\right]^2
\end{align*}
Write \(\beta = \prod_{g \in G \setminus \{1\}} \chi_V(g)\); we see that
\(\beta\) is real and \(|\beta| \in (0, 1)\).</p>
<p>From part (a), we may choose a basis of \(V\) so that all entries
of the matrices for elements of \(G\) are algebraic. This implies that the
numbers \(|\chi_V(g)|\) are all algebraic and belong to a common field \(K
\subseteq \mathbb{C}\) that is a Galois extension of \(\mathbb{Q}\), as in part
(a). Let \(\sigma \in \operatorname{Gal}(K/\mathbb{Q})\); then applying
\(\sigma\) to all the matrix entries produces another irreducible
representation \(\sigma(V)\) of \(G\), in which \(
\prod_{g\in G\setminus\{1\}} \chi_{\sigma(V)}(g)\) is a real number whose
absolute value lies in \((0, 1)\); but
\begin{align*}
\prod_{g \in G\setminus\{1\}} \chi_{\sigma(V)}(g)
&amp;= \prod_{g \in G\setminus\{1\}} \tr \sigma(\rho(g)) \\
&amp;= \prod_{g \in G\setminus\{1\}} \sigma(\tr \rho(g)) \\
&amp;= \prod_{g \in G\setminus\{1\}} \sigma(\chi_V(g)) \\
&amp;= \sigma\left(\prod_{g \in G\setminus\{1\}} \chi_V(g) \right) \\
&amp;= \sigma(\beta)
\end{align*}
thus all conjugates of \(\beta\) have absolute value strictly between 0 and 1.
Now the results of section 4.4 imply that \(\chi(g)\) is the sum of roots of
unity for all \(g \in G\); each root of unity is an algebraic integer, so each
\(\chi(g)\) is also an algebraic integer. The number \(\beta\), being a
product of such values, is also an algebraic integer. This implies that its
minimal polynomial has integer constant term. But this constant term is the
product of the algebraic conjugates of \(\beta\), which is strictly between 0
and 1 in absolute value; thus, a contradiction has been reached.</p>
