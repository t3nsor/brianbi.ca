<ol class="subproblems">
<li><p>The map \(\rho_U : A \to \End_k U\) is obviously linear whenever \(f\)
is. In order for \(\rho_U\) to be an algebra homomorphism, it is sufficient and
necessary that, additionally, \(\rho_U(ab) = \rho_U(a)\rho_U(b)\) for all
\(a, b \in A\). That is
\[
\begin{pmatrix}
\rho_V(ab) &amp; f(ab) \\
0 &amp; \rho_W(ab)
\end{pmatrix} =
\begin{pmatrix}
\rho_V(a) &amp; f(a) \\
0 &amp; \rho_W(a)
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
\rho_V(b) &amp; f(b) \\
0 &amp; \rho_W(b)
\end{pmatrix}
\]
Using the fact that \(\rho_V(ab) = \rho_V(a)\rho_V(b)\) and
\(\rho_W(ab) = \rho_W(a)\rho_W(b)\), and expanding out the RHS, we arrive at
the equivalent condition
\[
f(ab) = \rho_V(a)f(b) + f(a)\rho_W(b)
\]
We make one useful observation here before proceeding. Substituting \(a = b =
1\) yields \(f(1) = \Id_V f(1) + f(1) \Id_W = 2f(1)\), therefore \(f(1) = 0\).
</p></li>
<li><p>For all \(a, b \in A\), we have
\begin{align*}
\mathrm{d}X(ab) &amp;= \rho_V(ab)X - X\rho_W(ab) \\
&amp;= \rho_V(a)\rho_V(b)X - X\rho_W(a)\rho_W(b) \\
&amp;= \rho_V(a)\rho_V(b)X - \rho_V(a)X\rho_W(b) + \rho_V(a)X\rho_W(b) -
X\rho_W(a)\rho_W(b) \\
&amp;= \rho_V(a)(\rho_V(b)X - X\rho_W(b)) + (\rho_V(a)X - X\rho_W(a))\rho_W(b)
\\
&amp;= \rho_V(a)\mathrm{d}X(b) + \mathrm{d}X(a)\rho_W(b)
\end{align*}
Therefore \(\mathrm{d}X\) is a cocycle.</p>
<p>The map \(\mathrm{d}X\) will be identically zero iff for all \(a \in A\),
\(w \in W\), we have \(\rho_V(a)Xw = X\rho_W(a)w\). This is the same as the
definition of \(X\) being a homomorphism between the representations \(\rho_V\)
and \(\rho_W\).</p>
<p>The map \(\mathrm{d} : \Hom_k(W, V) \to \Hom_k(A, \Hom_k(W, V))\) is easily
seen to be linear. We have determined that \(\ker \mathrm{d} = \Hom_A(W, V)\).
The first isomorphism theorem implies that \(\im \mathrm{d} \cong
\Hom_k(W, V)/\Hom_A(W, V)\).</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose \(f, f' \in Z^1(W, V)\) with \(f - f' \in B^1(W, V)\). The
corresponding representations are
\[
\rho_U(a) = \begin{pmatrix} \rho_V(a) &amp; f(a) \\
0 &amp; \rho_W(a) \end{pmatrix}
\qquad
\rho_{U'}(a) = \begin{pmatrix} \rho_V(a) &amp; f'(a) \\
0 &amp; \rho_W(a) \end{pmatrix}
\]
Suppose \(X \in \Hom_k(W, V)\). Define
\[
\varphi_X = \begin{pmatrix} \Id_V &amp; X \\
0 &amp; \Id_W \end{pmatrix}
\]
\(\varphi_X\) is always invertible, therefore it is always an isomorphism of
\(U\) and \(U'\) as vector spaces. For each \(a \in A\),
\begin{align*}
\rho_U(a) \varphi_X - \varphi_X \rho_{U'}(a)
&amp;= \begin{pmatrix} \rho_V(a) &amp; f(a) \\
0 &amp; \rho_W(a) \end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix} \Id_V &amp; X \\
0 &amp; \Id_W \end{pmatrix} -
\begin{pmatrix} \Id_V &amp; X \\
0 &amp; \Id_W \end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix} \rho_V(a) &amp; f'(a) \\
0 &amp; \rho_W(a) \end{pmatrix} \\
&amp;= \begin{pmatrix} \rho_V &amp; \rho_V(a) X + f(a) \\
0 &amp; \rho_W \\ \end{pmatrix} -
\begin{pmatrix} \rho_V &amp; f'(a) + X\rho_W(a) \\
0 &amp; \rho_W \\ \end{pmatrix} \\
&amp;= \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; (\rho_V(a) X - X \rho_W(a)) - (f'(a) - f(a)) \\
0 &amp; 0 \\ \end{pmatrix} \\
&amp;= 0
\end{align*}
therefore \(\varphi_X : U \to U'\) is an isomorphism of representations if and
only if \(\rho_V(a)X - X\rho_W(a) = f'(a) - f(a)\) for all \(a \in A\), or in
other words if and only if \(f' - f = \mathrm{d}X\).</p>
<p>Therefore, if \(f' - f \in B^1(W, V)\), then with the choice of \(X\) such
that \(\mathrm{d}X = f' - f\), we obtain the isomorphism of representations
\(\varphi_X : U \to U'\); conversely, if \(U\) and \(U'\) are
isomorphic representations with the isomorphism of the form \(\varphi_X\) for
some \(X\) then it must be that \(f' - f = \mathrm{d}X\), so that
\(f' - f \in B^1(W, V)\).</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose \(f, f' \in \mathrm{Ext}^1(W, V)\) with \(f' = \lambda f\) where
\(\lambda \in k^\times\). We can choose representatives \(g, g' \in Z^1(W, V)\)
of \(f, f'\) respectively so that \(g' = \lambda g\) also. Define
\(\varphi : U_g \to U_{g'}\) by
\[
\varphi = \begin{pmatrix} \Id_V &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; \lambda \Id_W \end{pmatrix}
\]
It is easily verified that for each \(a \in A\), \(\varphi \circ
\rho_{U_g}(a) = \rho_{U_{g'}}(a) \circ \varphi\), so \(\varphi\) is a
homomorphism of representations. The matrix of \(\varphi\) is invertible, so
the representations \(U_g, U_{g'}\) are isomorphic.</p>
<p>Conversely, suppose \(g, g' \in Z^1(W, V)\) are given and that there is an
isomorphism \(\varphi : U_g \to U_{g'}\). In block form, suppose
\[
\varphi = \begin{pmatrix} \varphi_1 &amp; \varphi_2 \\
\varphi_3 &amp; \varphi_4 \end{pmatrix}
\]
The condition \(\varphi \circ U_g(a) = U_{g'}(a) \circ \varphi\) for all
\(a \in A\) implies, after expanding both sides and equating blocks on each
side,
\begin{align}
\varphi_1 \rho_V(a) &amp;= \rho_V(a) \varphi_1 + g'(a) \varphi_3
\label{eqn:iso1} \\
\varphi_1 g(a) + \varphi_2 \rho_W(a) &amp;= \rho_V(a) \varphi_2 +
g'(a) \varphi_4 \label{eqn:iso2} \\
\varphi_3 \rho_V(a) &amp;= \rho_W(a) \varphi_3 \label{eqn:iso3} \\
\varphi_3 g(a) + \varphi_4 \rho_W(a) &amp;= \rho_W(a) \varphi_4
\label{eqn:iso4}
\end{align}
for all \(a \in A\).</p>
<p>\(\pref{eqn:iso3}\) implies that \(\varphi_3 : V \to W\) is a homomorphism
of representations. By Schur's lemma, either \(\varphi_3 = 0\), or
\(\varphi_3\) is an isomorphism.</p>
<p>Consider first the case that \(\varphi_3 = 0\). Then \(\pref{eqn:iso1}\)
and \(\pref{eqn:iso4}\) respectively simplify to
\begin{align*}
\varphi_1 \rho_V(a) &amp;= \rho_V(a) \varphi_1 \\
\varphi_4 \rho_W(a) &amp;= \rho_W(a) \varphi_4
\end{align*}
so \(\varphi_1\) and \(\varphi_4\) are respectively endomorphisms of the
representations \(V\) and \(W\). By Schur's lemma, each is a scalar operator,
say, \(\varphi_1 = \lambda \Id_V\) and \(\varphi_4 = \mu \Id_W\). Then
\(\pref{eqn:iso2}\) simplifies to
\[
\lambda g(a) + \varphi_2 \rho_W(a) = \rho_V(a) \varphi_2 + \mu g'(a)
\]
that is
\[
\rho_V(a) \varphi_2 - \varphi_2 \rho_W(a) = \mathrm{d}\varphi_2 = \lambda g(a)
- \mu g'(a)
\]
so \(\lambda g - \mu g' \in B^1(W, V)\). Let \(f, f'\) denote the projections
of \(g, g'\) onto \(\mathrm{Ext}^1(W, V)\); then \(f' =
\frac{\lambda}{\mu}f\).</p>
<p><em>(Travis Hance supplied this part of the proof.)</em> On the other hand,
if \(\varphi_3\) is an isomorphism, then left-multiply
both sides of \(\pref{eqn:iso4}\) by \(\varphi_3^{-1}\) to give
\[
g(a) + \varphi_3^{-1} \varphi_4 \rho_W(a) = \varphi_3^{-1}\rho_W(a)\varphi_4
\]
Now \(\varphi^{-1}\) is an isomorphism from \(W\) to \(V\), so
\(\varphi_3^{-1}\rho_W(a) = \rho_V(a) \varphi_3^{-1}\). Consequently
\[
g(a) = \varphi_3^{-1} \rho_W(a) \varphi_4 - \varphi_3^{-1} \varphi_4 \rho_W(a)
= \rho_V(a) \varphi_3^{-1}\varphi_4 - \varphi_3^{-1}\varphi_4 \rho_W(a) =
\mathrm{d}(\varphi_3^{-1}\varphi_4)
\]
so \(g \in B^1(W, V)\). Similarly, \(\pref{eqn:iso1}\) will show that
\(g' \in B^1(W, V)\). Therefore \(f = f' = 0\).</li>

<p><span class="problem">Problem 3.9.2</span></p>
<ol class="subproblems">
<li><p>Suppose \(f\) is a cocycle,
\begin{equation}
f(PQ) = \rho_b(P)f(Q) + f(P)\rho_a(Q) = P(b)f(Q) + Q(a)f(P)
\label{eqn:coc}
\end{equation}
where we have written \(\rho_a, \rho_b\) for \(\rho_{V_a}, \rho_{V_b}\) for
brevity. To proceed, we analyze two cases.</p>
<p>First, suppose that there exists some \(i\) with \(a_i \ne b_i\). Without
loss of generality, say \(a_1 \ne b_1\). Let \(j \in \{1, \ldots, n\}\) be
given. Then \(\pref{eqn:coc}\) implies
\begin{align*}
f(x_1 x_j) &amp;= b_1 f(x_j) + a_j f(x_1) \\
f(x_j x_1) &amp;= b_j f(x_1) + a_1 f(x_j)
\end{align*}
Since \(x_1 x_j = x_j x_1\), rearranging yields
\[
f(x_j) = (b_j - a_j)\frac{f(x_1)}{b_1 - a_1}
\]
Let \(\lambda = f(x_1)/(b_1 - a_1)\). It follows that for all
\(j \in \{1, \ldots, n\}\), we have
\[
f(x_j) = (b_j - a_j)\lambda
\]
The choice of the map \(\lambda : W \to V\) therefore suffices to determine the
function \(f : A \to \Hom_{\mathbb{C}}(W, V)\). Define \(f' : A \to
\Hom_{\mathbb{C}}(V_a, V_b)\) by
\[
f'(P) = (P(b) - P(a))\lambda
\]
Then \(f'\) is linear in its argument \(P\), agrees with \(f\) when \(P =
x_i\) for some \(i\), and satisfies \(\pref{eqn:coc}\), so \(f = f'\). Since
\(\Hom_{\mathbb{C}}(V_a, V_b)\) from which \(\lambda\) is drawn is
one-dimensional, \(Z^1(V_a, V_b)\) is also one-dimensional. But observe that
\(\mathrm{d}\lambda(P) = \rho_b(P) \lambda - \lambda \rho_a(P) =
(P(b) - P(a))\lambda = f\), so every such \(f\) is a coboundary. Therefore
\(\mathrm{Ext}^1(V_a, V_b)\) is trivial.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if \(a_i = b_i\) for all \(i\), then in fact the \(n\)
operators \(\lambda_i = f(x_i)\), which determine \(f\), can be chosen
independently. The \(f\) that satisfies \(\pref{eqn:coc}\) and \(f(x_i) =
\lambda_i\) for each \(i\) is given by
\[
f(P) = \sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i P_i(a)
\]
where \(P_i\) denotes the (formal) partial derivative \(\d P/\d x_i\). The
space \(Z^1(V_a, V_a)\) therefore
has dimension \(n\). It is easy to check that \(B^1(V_a, V_a) = 0\) (indeed,
\(B^1(V, V)\) must be trivial for any one-dimensional representation of any
algebra), so
\(\mathrm{Ext}^1(V_a, V_a)\) has dimension \(n\). Extensions of \(V_a\) by
\(V_a\) are therefore parametrized by \([c_1 : \ldots : c_n] \in
\mathbb{P}\mathbb{C}^n\) with
\[
f(P) = \sum_{i=1}^n c_i P_i(a) \Id
\]</p>
<p>With these results we can classify the two-dimensional representations of
\(A\). Since \(A\) is commutative, only the one-dimensional representations are
irreducible. Let \(V\) be a two-dimensional representation, let \(V_b\) be a
one-dimensional subrepresentation, and let \(V_a = V/V_b\). If \(a \ne b\) then
\(\mathrm{Ext}^1(V_a, V_b) = 0\) so the extension \(V\) is trivial, that is,
\(V \cong V_a \oplus V_b\). In the case where \(a = b\), we likewise have the
representations \(V_a \oplus V_a\). Write \(V_{ab} = V_a \oplus V_b\), where
\(a, b\) may be the same or different.</p>
<p>Since \(\mathrm{Ext}^1(V_a, V_a)\) is nontrivial, in the case \(a = b\) we
also have indecomposable representations of the form
\[
\rho_V(x_i) = \begin{pmatrix} a_i &amp; c_i \\
0 &amp; a_i \end{pmatrix}
\]
where \([c_1 : \ldots : c_n] \in \mathbb{P}\mathbb{C}^n\). Denote such a
representation by \(U_{ac}\).</p>
<p>We have therefore two kinds of two-dimensional representations,</p>
<ol>
<li>The representations \(V_{ab} = V_a \oplus V_b\) where \(a, b \in
\mathbb{C}^n\)</li>
<li>The representations \(U_{ac}\) where \(a \in \mathbb{C}^n, b \in
\mathbb{P}\mathbb{C}^n \setminus \{0\}\)</li>
</ol>
<p>No \(V_{ab}\) is isomorphic to any \(U_{a'c}\) since the latter are all
indecomposable while the former are not. The Krull&ndash;Schmidt theorem
implies that \(V_{ab} \cong V_{a'b'}\) if and only if \(a, b\) is a permutation
of \(a', b'\). The result of Problem 3.9.1(d) implies that \(U_{ac}\) and
\(U_{ac'}\) are isomorphic only when \(c = c'\). Finally, when \(a \ne a'\),
the representations \(U_{ac}\) and \(U_{a'c'}\) cannot be isomorphic since
if \(a_i \ne a'_i\) then \(x_i\) will have a different eigenvalue in the two
representations.</p></li>
<li><p>The algebra \(B\) has a unique irreducible representation \(V\), in
which \(\rho_V(x_i) = 0\) for all \(i\). Suppose \(f\) is a cocycle. Because
\(x_i x_j = 0\) for all \(i, j\), the cocycle condition \(f(ab) = \rho_V(a)
f(b) + f(b) \rho_W(a)\) doesn't constrain the values of \(f(x_i)\) at all, so
each choice of \((c_1, \ldots, c_n) \in \mathbb{C}^n\) yields a cocycle
\(f_c\) with \(f_c(x_i) = c_i \Id\). Again \(B^1(V, V) = 0\), so if
\(c = [c_1 : \ldots : c_n]\) is understood projectively, then the result of
Problem 3.9.1(d) implies that for \(n &gt; 1\) we have an
infinite family of nonisomorphic indecomposable extensions of the form
\[
\rho(x_i) = \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; c_i \\
0 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix}
\]
where \(c\) ranges over the infinite set \(\mathbb{P}\mathbb{C}^n\).</p></li>
</ol>

<p><span class="problem">Problem 3.9.3</span> Obviously all one-dimensional
representations of \(P_Q\) are irreducible. We claim that the converse is also
true. Let \(V\) be a nonzero representation of \(P_Q\), so a vector space
\(V_i\) is associated to each vertex of \(Q\), and \(V =
\bigoplus_{i\in Q} V_i\). Let \(Q'\) be the set of vertices to which a nonzero
vector space has been assigned. Let \(v\) be some member of \(Q'\) from which
no other member of \(Q'\) is reachable. Then \(V_v\) is a subrepresentation of
\(V\) in which \(p_v\) acts as the identity, \(p_w\) acts as zero for all
vertices \(w \in Q \setminus \{v\}\), and \(a_e\) acts as zero for all edges
\(e \in Q\). Each one-dimensional subspace of \(V_v\) is itself a
subrepresentation. Therefore, if \(V\) is irreducible, then it must be
one-dimensional.</p>
<p>The one-dimensional representations of \(P_Q\) are obtained by choosing some
vertex \(v \in Q\) and assigning a one-dimensional vector space to \(v\) and
the zero vector space to all other vertices. Explicitly
\begin{align*}
\rho(p_w) &amp;= \delta_{vw} \Id \\
\rho(a_e) &amp;= 0
\end{align*}
We will denote this representation by \((V_v, \rho_v)\). It is easy to see
that \(V_v\) and \(V_w\) are nonisomorphic when \(v \ne w\), as the former
has \(\rho_v(w) = 0\) and the latter has \(\rho_w(w) = \Id\).</p>
<p>Let us now compute \(Z^1(V_w, V_v)\).
Let \(f\) be a cocycle. Let \(x, y\) be vertices and \(a\) an
edge. By the cocycle condition and the defining relations of \(P_Q\),
\begin{gather}
f(\delta_{xy} p_x) = f(p_x p_y) = \rho_v(p_x) f(p_y) + f(p_x) \rho_w(p_y) =
\delta_{vx} f(p_y) + \delta_{wy} f(p_x) \label{eqn:q1} \\
f(\delta_{a''v} a) = f(p_v a) = \rho_v(p_v) f(a) + f(p_v) \rho_w(p_v) =
f(a) + \delta_{wv} f(p_v) \label{eqn:q2} \\
f(\delta_{a'w} a) = f(a p_w) = \rho_v(a) f(p_w) + f(a) \rho_w(p_w) =
f(a) + \delta_{vw} f(p_w) \label{eqn:q3}
\end{gather}
We proceed by cases. First, suppose \(v \ne w\). Then
\(\pref{eqn:q2}\) and \(\pref{eqn:q3}\) become
\[
f(a) = f(\delta_{a'' v}a) = f(\delta_{a'w}a)
\]
which implies that \(f(a) = 0\) unless \(a\) is an edge from \(w\) to \(v\).
In \(\pref{eqn:q1}\), substitute \(x = v, y = w\) to obtain
\[
0 = f(p_w) + f(p_v)
\]
Or, if \(x\) is different from both \(v\) and \(w\), substitute \(y = w\) to
obtain
\[
0 = f(p_x)
\]
Thus \(Z^1(\rho_v, \rho_w)\) is parametrized by \(\lambda \in \Hom_k(V_w,
V_v)\) and \(\mu_a \in \Hom_k(V_w, V_v)\) where \(a\) ranges over the edges
from \(w\) to \(v\), with \(f(\rho_w) = \lambda, f(\rho_v) = -\lambda\),
\(f(a) = \mu_a\) if \(a\) is an edge from \(w\) to \(v\), and \(f\) vanishes
on any other path.</p>
<p>If \(X \in \Hom_k(V_v, V_w)\) then the coboundary \(\d X\) is
\(\d X(a) = \rho_W(a) X - X \rho_V(a)\), implying
\begin{align*}
\d X(p_w) &amp;= X \\
\d X(p_v) &amp;= -X \\
\end{align*}
and \(\d X(a) = 0\) where \(a\) is any other path. So two cocycles differing
only in the choice of \(\lambda\) become equivalent in
\(\mathrm{Ext}^1(V_w, V_v)\), so the latter is
parametrized by the \(\mu_a\)'s alone, and has dimension \(d(w, v)\) (the
number of directed edges from \(w\) to \(v\)).</p>
<p>Now consider the case where \(v = w\). In \(\pref{eqn:q1}\), substitute
\(x = y = v\) to obtain
\[
f(p_v) = f(p_v p_v) = f(p_v) + f(p_v)
\]
therefore \(f(p_v) = 0\). Or, if \(x\) is different from \(v\), substitute
\(y = v\) to obtain
\[
0 = f(p_x p_v) = f(p_x)
\]
so \(f\) vanishes for all vertices. Therefore, \(\pref{eqn:q2}\) and
\(\pref{eqn:q3}\) become
\[
f(a) = f(\delta_{a''v}a) = f(\delta_{a'v}a)
\]
Since \(Q\) doesn't contain any oriented cycles, there is no self-edge from
\(v\), so at least one of \(\delta_{a''v}\) and \(\delta_{a'v}\) must be zero
for all \(a\). So in fact \(f\) vanishes identically. Therefore,
\(Z^1(V_v, V_v)\) and \(\mathrm{Ext}^1(V_v, V_v)\) are trivial.</p>
<p>The result that \(\mathrm{Ext}^1(V_v, V_v)\) is trivial can actually be seen
as a special case of the result that \(\mathrm{Ext}^1(V_w, V_v)\) has dimension
equal to \(d(w, v)\), since \(d(v, v) = 0\) in \(Q\), although the proofs of
the two cases were slightly different</p>
<p>We can now classify the two-dimensional representations of \(P_Q\). Let
\(V\) be such a representation. It always has some one-dimensional
subrepresentation, which is isomorphic to \(V_v\) for some vertex \(v\). The
quotient \(V/V_v\) is a one-dimensional representation, which is isomorphic to
\(V_w\) for some vertex \(w\). \(\mathrm{Ext}^1(V_w, V_v)\) has dimension equal
to \(d(w, v)\), the number of directed edges from \(w\) to \(v\). Let
\(\varphi : V_w \to V_v\) be an arbitrary nonzero linear map.
The result of Problem 3.9.1(d) implies that all extensions of \(V_w\) by
\(V_v\) are of the form \(U_{vwc}\), parametrized by
\(c = [c_1 : \ldots : c_{d(w, v)}] \in \mathbb{P}k^{d(w, v)}\), with
\[
\rho_{vwc}(a) = \begin{pmatrix} \rho_v(a) &amp; f_{vwc}(a) \\
0 &amp; \rho_w(a) \end{pmatrix}
\]
where \(f_{vwc}\) is the cocycle that assigns \(c_i \varphi\) to the
\(i\)<sup>th</sup> edge from \(w\) to \(v\).</p>
<p>Observe that \(U_{vwc}\) has the property that
\(\rho(p_x)\) vanishes precisely when \(x\) is different from both \(v\) and
\(w\). This implies that if \(U_{vwc} \cong U_{v'w'c'}\) then the two sets
\(\{v, w\}\) and \(\{v', w'\}\) coincide. In the case where \(v = v'\) and
\(w = w'\), the result of Problem 3.9.1(d) implies that \(U_{vwc} \cong
U_{vwc'}\) if and only if \(c = c'\). We must still determine when
\(U_{vwc}\) and \(U_{wvc'}\) can be isomorphic. If \(c = c' = 0\), then
\(U_{vwc} \cong V_v \oplus V_w\) and \(U_{wvc'} \cong V_w \oplus V_v\) so they
are isomorphic. If \(c \ne 0\), then there is at least one edge \(a\) from
\(w\) to \(v\) such that \(c_a \ne 0\), implying \(\rho_{vwc}(a) \ne 0\), but
then there cannot be an edge from \(v\) to \(w\), so in \(U_{wvc'}\) we must
have \(\rho_{wvc}(a) = 0\). So in this case \(U_{vwc} \not\cong U_{wvc'}\). And
similar reasoning shows that \(U_{vwc} \not\cong U_{wvc'}\) whenever \(c' \ne
0\). So the nonisomorphic two-dimensional representations of \(P_Q\) are as
follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The direct sums \(V_v \oplus V_w\) where \(v\) and \(w\) may be the same or
different from each other;</li>
<li>The indecomposable representations \(U_{vwc}\) parametrized by
\(c \in \mathbb{P}k^{d(w, v)} \setminus \{0\}\), which exist only when there is
at least one edge from \(w\) to \(v\).</li>
</ul>
<p>The representations \(V_{vv}\) assign a two-dimensional vector space to
the vertex \(v\) and the zero space to all vertices. The representations
\(V_{vw}\) with \(v \ne w\) assign a one-dimensional vector space to \(v\), a
one-dimensional vector space to \(w\), the zero space to all other vertices,
and the zero map to all edges. The representations \(U_{vwc}\) with \(c \ne 0\)
assign a one-dimensional vector space to each of \(v\) and \(w\), the zero
space to all other edges, an arbitrary map to each edge from \(w\) to \(v\)
as determined by the corresponding element of \(c\) (but subject to the
restriction that at least one edge has a nonzero map) and zero to all other
edges; such representations are indecomposable and the \(V_v\) subspace is
clearly identifiable by reducing the space assigned to \(w\) to the zero
space. Notice that scaling all the edges from \(w\) to \(v\) results in an
isomorphic representation since it has the same effect as simply rescaling the
basis vector for the space assigned to either \(v\) or \(w\).</p>

<ol class="subproblems"><li><p>We will state some useful facts
here without proof:</p>
<ul>
<li>If \(R\) is any (possibly non-commutative) ring and \(R[[t]]\) is the ring
of formal power series with
coefficients in \(R\), and \(f, g \in R[[t]]\), and \(n \in \mathbb{N}\), then
the coefficient of
\(t^n\) in \(fg\) is determined by the coefficients of \(1, t, \ldots, t^n\) in
\(f\) and \(g\).</li>
<li>If \(f \in R[[t]]\) and the constant term of \(f\) is a unit in \(R\), then
\(f\) is a unit in \(R[[t]]\), and for each \(n \in \mathbb{N}\), the
coefficient of \(t^n\) in \(f^{-1}\) is determined by the coefficients of
\(1, t, \ldots, t^n\) in \(f\).</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, suppose \(A\) and \((V, p)\) are given as in the problem, with
\(\mathrm{Ext}^1(V, V) = 0\).</p>
<p class="lemma">Suppose \(n \in \mathbb{N}\) and \(n \ge 1\). Suppose
\(\tilde\rho = \rho + t\rho_1 + t^2\rho_2 + \ldots \) is a deformation of
\(\rho\) such that the coefficient of \(t^i\) vanishes identically (that is,
for all \(a\)\) whenever \(1 \le i \le n-1\); that is, \(\tilde\rho = \rho +
t^n \rho_n + O(t^{n+1})\). Then there exists \(b \in
\End V\) such that the coefficient of \(t^i\) in \((1 + t^n b)\tilde\rho
(1 + t^n b)^{-1}\) vanishes whenever \(1 \le i \le n\).</p>
<p class="proof">We have \(\tilde\rho(ab) = \tilde\rho(a)\tilde\rho(b)\) for
all \(a, b \in A\). That is, \(\rho(ab) + t^n \rho_n(ab) + O(t^{n+1}) =
(\rho(a) + t^n \rho_n(a) + O(t^{n+1}))(\rho(b) + t^n \rho_n(b) +
O(t^{n+1}))\), and equating coefficients of \(t^n\), this
implies
\[
\rho_n(ab) = \rho(a)\rho_n(b) + \rho_n(a)\rho(b)
\]
so \(\rho_n \in Z^1(V, V)\). Since \(\mathrm{Ext}^1(V, V) = 0\), this implies
\(\rho_n \in B^1(V, V)\), so there exists \(b \in \End V\) such that
\[
\rho_n = \rho b - b \rho
\]
Then
\begin{align*}
(1 + t^n b)\tilde\rho(1 + t^n b)^{-1}
&amp;= (1 + t^n b + O(t^{n+1}))(\rho + t^n \rho_n + O(t^{n+1}))
(1 - t^n b + O(t^{n+1})) \\
&amp;= (\rho + t^n(b\rho + \rho_n) + O(t^{n+1}))(1 - t^n b + O(t^{n+1})) \\
&amp;= \rho + t^n(-\rho b + b\rho + \rho_n) + O(t^{n+1}) \\
&amp;= \rho + O(t^{n+1})
\end{align*}
as required.</p>
<p>Let \(\tilde\rho\) be any given deformation of \(\rho\). The Lemma implies
that we can choose \(b_1 \in \End V\) so that \((1 + tb_1)\tilde\rho
(1 + tb_1)^{-1}\) has vanishing linear term. Then, the Lemma implies that we
can choose \(b_2 \in \End V\) so that \((1 + t^2 b_2)(1 + tb_1)\tilde\rho
(1 + tb_1)^{-1}(1 + t^2 b_2)^{-1}\) has vanishing linear and quadratic terms,
and so on. We will assume the axiom of dependent choice and assert that there
is therefore an infinite sequence \(b_1, b_2, \ldots\) with \(b_i \in \End V\)
such that for each \(n \in \mathbb{N}\), the coefficients of \(t^1, \ldots,
t^n\) in \((\prod_{i=1}^n 1 + t^i b_i)\tilde\rho
(\prod_{i=1}^n 1 + t^i b_i)^{-1}\) vanish identically.</p>
<p>Let \(b = \prod_{i=1}^\infty 1 + t^i b_i\). This is well-defined because
only factors with \(i \le n\) contribute to the coefficient of \(t^n\) in the
product. Consider the representation \(\tilde{\tilde\rho} = b\tilde\rho
b^{-1}\).  Clearly the constant term of \(\tilde{\tilde\rho}\) is \(\rho\). For
\(n \ge 1\), the coefficient of \(t^n\) in \(\tilde{\tilde\rho}\) is determined
by \(\tilde\rho\) and the coefficients of \(b\) and \(b^{-1}\) up to degree
\(n\). But \(b = O(t^{n+1}) + \prod_{i=1}^n 1 + t^i b_i\) and
\(b^{-1} = O(t^{n+1}) + (\prod_{i=1}^n 1 + t^i b^i)^{-1}\), therefore the
coefficient of \(t^n\) in \(b\tilde\rho b^{-1}\) is 0 by construction of the
\(b_i\)'s. This holds for all \(n\), therefore \(\tilde{\tilde\rho} =
\rho\) and we conclude that \(\rho\) and \(\tilde\rho\) are
isomorphic.</p><div class="qed"></div></li>
<li><p>Let \(A = \mathbb{C}[x]/x^2\). This algebra is obtained by setting
\(n = 1\) in the class of algebras described in Problem 3.9.2(b). We found that
such an algebra has a unique irreducible representation \((V, \rho)\), of
dimension one, in which \(x\) acts as the zero operator, and that the space
\(\mathrm{Ext}^1(V, V)\) has dimension
\(n\). In particular, for \(n = 1\), \(\mathrm{Ext}^1(V, V)\) is nonzero.</p>
<p>Let \(\tilde\rho = \rho + t \rho_1 + t^2 \rho_2 + \ldots\) be a deformation
of \(\rho\). We will show that \(\rho_i = 0\) for all \(i \ge 1\). The proof
is by induction. For the inductive case, suppose that \(\rho_1 = \rho_2 =
\ldots = \rho_{i-1} = 0\). Then we have \(\tilde\rho = \rho + t^i \rho_i +
O(t^{i+1})\). Now
\begin{align*}
1 + t^i \rho_i(1) + O(t^{i+1}) &amp;= \tilde\rho(1) = \tilde\rho(1 \cdot 1) =
\tilde\rho(1)^2 \\
&amp;= (1 + t^i \rho_i(1) + O(t^{i+1}))^2 \\
&amp;= 1 + 2 t^i \rho_i(1) + O(t^{i+1})
\end{align*}
which implies that \(\rho_i(1) = 0\). Also
\begin{align*}
0 &amp;= \tilde\rho(0) = \tilde\rho(x^2) = \tilde\rho(x)^2 \\
&amp;= (\rho(x) + t^i \rho_i(x) + O(t^{i+1}))^2 =
(t^i \rho_i(x) + O(t^{i+1}))^2 \\
&amp;= t^{2i} \rho_i(x)^2 + O(t^{2i+1})
\end{align*}
therefore \(\rho_i(x)^2 = 0\), and since \(\rho_i(x) \in \End V \cong
\mathbb{C}\), this means \(\rho_i(x)\) is just 0. As \(\{1, x\}\) is a basis of
\(A\), we have established that \(\rho_i = 0\). For the base case, just put
\(i = 1\) and this argument still works because the assumptions that
\(\rho_1 = \rho_2 = \ldots = \rho_{i-1} = 0\) are vacuous.</p>
<p>So \(\mathrm{Ext}^1(V, V)\) is nontrivial and yet all deformations of \(V\)
are trivial. The converse to (a) does not hold.</p></li>

<li><p>If \(\dim V = m\), then a spanning set for \(\mathrm{Cl}(V)\) is given
by monomials of the form \(x_{i_1} x_{i_2} \ldots x_{i_p}\)
where \(1 \le i_1 &lt; i_2 &lt; \ldots &lt; i_p \le m\); the proof of this is
not difficult, so we omit it, but the important consequence is that
\(\dim\mathrm{Cl}(V) \le 2^m\).</p>
<p>Suppose \(m = 2n\) and the bilinear form \(\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle\)
is nondegenerate. We use the fact that all nondegenerate symmetric bilinear
forms can be diagonalized (we will not prove this here). Following the Hint,
let \(e_1, \ldots, e_n, f_1, \ldots,
f_n\) be an orthnormal basis of \(V\) with respect to \(\langle \cdot, \cdot
\rangle\), and define
\begin{align*}
a_i &amp;= \frac{1}{2}(e_i + if_i) \\
b_i &amp;= \frac{1}{2}(e_i - if_i)
\end{align*}
Then \(a_1, \ldots, a_n, b_1, \ldots, b_n\) form a basis of \(V\) in which
\(\langle a_i, a_j \rangle = \langle b_i, b_j \rangle = 0\) and
\(\langle a_i, b_j \rangle = \delta_{ij}/2\), as in the Hint. Let \(S\) be the
vector space \(\wedge(a_1, \ldots, a_n)\). For each \(i\), define
\begin{align*}
\rho(a_i)(\omega) &amp;= a_i \wedge \omega \\
\rho(b_i)(\omega) &amp;= \iota_{a_i} \omega
\end{align*}
and extend \(\rho\) to an algebra homomorphism \(\rho : \mathbb{C}\langle
a_1, \ldots, a_n, b_1, \ldots, b_n \rangle \to \End S\). Observe that
\begin{align*}
\rho(a_i a_j + a_j a_i - 2\langle a_i, a_j \rangle)(\omega)
&amp;= \rho(a_i)\rho(a_j)(\omega) + \rho(a_j)\rho(a_i)(\omega) \\
&amp;= a_i \wedge (a_j \wedge \omega) + a_j \wedge (a_i \wedge \omega) \\
&amp;= (a_i \wedge a_j) \wedge \omega + (a_j \wedge a_i) \wedge \omega \\
&amp;= (a_i \wedge a_j + a_j \wedge a_i) \wedge \omega \\
&amp;= 0
\end{align*}
and
\begin{align*}
\rho(b_i b_j + b_j b_i - 2\langle b_i, b_j \rangle)(\omega)

&amp;= \iota_{a_i} \iota_{a_j} \omega + \iota_{a_j} \iota_{a_i}(\omega) \\
&amp;= 0
\end{align*}
where we have used the identity \(\iota_X \iota_Y = -\iota_Y \iota_X\), and
\begin{align*}
\rho(a_i b_j + b_j a_i - 2\langle a_i, b_j\rangle)(\omega)
&amp;= \rho(a_i)\rho(b_j)(\omega) + \rho(b_j)\rho(a_i)(\omega) -
\delta_{ij}\omega \\

a_i \wedge \iota_{a_j}\omega - \delta_{ij}\omega \\
&amp;= \delta_{ij} \omega - \delta_{ij}\omega \\
&amp;= 0
\end{align*}
where we have used the graded Leibniz identity
\[
\iota_X(\omega_1 \wedge \omega_2) = (\iota_X \omega_1) \wedge \omega_2 +
(-1)^k \omega_1 \wedge (\iota_X \omega_2)
\]
where \(\omega\) is a \(k\)-form. Since \(\rho\) vanishes on the ideal
generated by the defining relations of \(\mathrm{Cl}(V)\), we can restrict
the domain of \(\rho\) to \(\mathrm{Cl}(V)\), forming a representation.</p>
<p>We now show that the representation \((S, \rho)\) is irreducible. Suppose
\(\omega \in S \setminus \{0\}\). Express \(\omega\) in the basis of \(S\)
induced by \(a_1, \ldots, a_n, b_1, \ldots, b_n\) and pick some \(k\)-form in
\(S\) of maximal grade with nonzero coefficient, say, \(c a_{i_1} \wedge \ldots
a_{i_p}\) where \(c \in \mathbb{C}\). Then
\(c^{-1} b_{i_p} \ldots b_{i_1} \omega = 1\), so every nonzero
subrepresentation of \(S\) contains the element \(1\). It is obvious that \(1\)
is cyclic in \(S\), so \(S\) is irreducible. The dimension of \(S\) is \(2^n\).
By Theorem 3.5.4, \(\dim \mathrm{Cl}(V) - \dim \mathrm{Rad}(\mathrm{Cl}(V))
\ge 2^{2n}\). Since
\(\dim \mathrm{Cl}(V) \le 2^{2n}\), this can only be satisfied if
\(\dim \mathrm{Cl}(V) = 2^{2n}\) and
\(\mathrm{Rad}(\mathrm{Cl}(V)) = 0\), so \(\mathrm{Cl}(V)\) is semisimple and
\((S, \rho)\) is its only unique irreducible representation.</p>
<p>In the case \(m = 2n + 1\), let the orthonormal basis be \(e_1, \ldots, e_n,
f_1, \ldots, f_n, c\) and define \(a_i, b_i\) as before. Then \(a_1, \ldots,
a_n, b_1, \ldots, b_n, c\) form a basis of \(V\) with \(\langle a_i, a_j
\rangle = \langle b_i, b_j \rangle = 0\), \(\langle a_i, b_j\rangle =
\delta_{ij}/2\), \(\langle a_i, c\rangle = \langle b_i, c\rangle = 0\), and
\(\langle c, c \rangle = 1\), as in the Hint. Let \(S = \wedge(a_1, \ldots,
a_n)\) as before. Define the maps \(\rho_+\) and \(\rho_-\) such that, when
\(\omega\) is a \(k\)-form,
\begin{align*}
\rho_\pm(a_i)(\omega) &amp;= a_i \wedge \omega \\
\rho_\pm(b_i)(\omega) &amp;= \iota_{a_i} \omega \\
\rho_+(c)(\omega) &amp;= (-1)^k c \\
\rho_-(c)(\omega) &amp;= (-1)^{k+1} c
\end{align*}
and extend \(\rho_\pm\) to algebra homomorphisms
\(\mathrm{C}\langle a_1, \ldots, a_n, b_1, \ldots, b_n, c\rangle \to \End S\).
\(\rho\) vanishes for the defining relations involving only \(a\)'s and \(b\)'s
as in the even case; also, where \(\omega\) is a \(k\)-form,
\begin{align*}
\rho_+(c^2 - \langle c, c\rangle)(\omega)
&amp;= \rho_+(c)(\rho_+(c)(\omega)) - \omega \\
&amp;= (-1)^k(-1)^k \omega - \omega \\
&amp;= 0
\end{align*}
and
\begin{align*}
\rho_+(a_i c + c a_i - \langle a_i, c \rangle)(\omega)
&amp;= \rho_+(a_i)(\rho_+(c)(\omega)) + \rho_+(c)(\rho_+(a_i)(\omega)) \\
&amp;= a_i \wedge ((-1)^k \omega) + (-1)^{k+1}(a_i \wedge \omega) \\
&amp;= (-1)^k a_i \wedge \omega + (-1)^{k+1}a_i \wedge \omega \\
&amp;= 0
\end{align*}
and
\begin{align*}
\rho_+(b_i c + c b_i - \langle b_i, c \rangle)(\omega)
&amp;= \rho_+(b_i)(\rho_+(c)(\omega)) + \rho_+(c)(\rho_+(b_i)(\omega)) \\
&amp;= \iota_{a_i}((-1)^k \omega) + (-1)^{k-1}(\iota_{a_i}\omega) \\
&amp;= (-1)^k\iota_{a_i}\omega + (-1)^{k-1}\iota_{a_i}\omega \\
&amp;= 0
\end{align*}
and similar relations hold for \(\rho_-\), and both can be extended by
linearity to all of \(S\). As in the even case, \(\rho_+\) and
\(\rho_-\) can therefore be restricted to \(\mathrm{Cl}(V)\) and become
representations of the latter,
which we respectively denote \(S_+\) and \(S_-\).</p>
<p>The proof that \(S_\pm\) are irreducible is the same as in the even
case.</p>
<p>Define \(\gamma =
c b_n \ldots b_2 b_1 a_1 a_2 \ldots a_n\). Then \(\gamma\) acts on \(S_+\) as
\((-1)^n\) times the
projection onto the one-dimensional subspace generated by the unit element of
\(S_+\) while \(\gamma\) acts on \(S_-\) as \((-1)^{n+1}\) times the similar
projection. Therefore \(\chi_{S_+}(\gamma) = (-1)^n\) and \(\chi_{S_-}(\gamma)
= (-1)^{n+1}\). This establishes that \(S_+\) and \(S_-\) are
nonisomorphic. Since \(S_+\) and \(S_-\) both have dimension \(2^n\), a
dimension-counting argument similar to that of the even case establishes that
\(\mathrm{Cl}(V)\) is semisimple and \(S_+\) and \(S_-\) are its only
irreducible representations.</p></li>
<li><p>If \(\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle\) is nondegenerate, we proved in part
(a) that the Clifford algebra is semisimple. If \(\langle \cdot, \cdot
\rangle\) is degenerate, form a basis \(x_1, \ldots, x_m\) of \(V\) such that
\(\langle x_i, x_j \rangle = 0\) when \(i \ne j\), and \(\langle x_i, x_i
\rangle = 1\) for \(1 \le i \le d\), and \(\langle x_i, x_i \rangle = 0\)
for \(d &lt; i \le n\), where \(d \in \{1, \ldots, n\}\). Consider the ideal
\(I_n = \langle x_n \rangle \subseteq A\). Suppose \(a, b \in I_n\). Then
\(a, b\) are linear combinations of terms of the form \(e x_n e'\) and
\(f x_n f'\), where \(e, f, e', f' \in \mathrm{Cl}(V)\). The product of these
two terms contributes a term \(e x_n e' f x_n f'\) to \(ab\).
Write \(e' f = \sum_{i=1}^p c_i g_i\) where the \(g_i\)'s come from the
spanning set of \(\mathrm{Cl}(V)\) described in part (a), and \(c_i \in
\mathbb{C}\). Then
\[
e x_n e' f x_n f' = \sum_{i=1}^p c_i e x_n g_i x_n f'
\]
Consider a single term in this sum, \(c_i e x_n g_i x_n f'\). Note that
\(x_n\) anticommutes with \(x_1, \ldots, x_{n-1}\), so if \(g_i\) contains
\(x_n\) then we can swap the final \(x_n\) with factors in \(g_i\) to put the
two \(x_n\)'s next to each other, showing that the product is 0. Otherwise,
swapping the final \(x_n\) with all the factors in \(g_i\) puts the two
\(x_n\)'s next to each other, so again the product is 0. Since this holds for
all terms in \(e x_n e' f x_n f'\), we conclude that the latter vanishes. Each
term in the product \(ab\) is of this form, so \(ab\) vanishes.
Since this holds for all
\(a, b \in I_n\), we conclude \(I_n^2 = 0\), so \(\mathrm{Cl}(V)\) is not
semisimple.</p>
<p>By similar reasoning, if \(I = \langle x_{d+1}, \ldots, x_n\rangle\) then
we can show that \(I^{n-d+1} = 0\). (The idea is to apply the pigeonhole
principle; each term in a product of \(n-d+1\) elements of \(I\) must contain
at least one of \(x_{d+1}, \ldots, x_n\) at least twice, causing the term to
vanish.) We pause here to prove a lemma that may seem obvious:</p>
<p class="lemma">Let \(A\) be a finite-dimensional algebra and let
\(I \subseteq A\) be a nilpotent (two-sided) ideal. If \(A/I\) is semisimple,
then \(I = \mathrm{Rad}(A)\).</p>
<p class="proof">Let \(\pi : A \to A/I\) be the quotient map. Suppose \(I'\) is
a nilpotent ideal of \(A\). Then \(\pi(I')\) is a nilpotent ideal of
\(A/I\). Since \(A/I\) is semisimple, Proposition 3.5.3 implies that
\(\pi(I')\) is the zero ideal. Therefore \(I' \subseteq \ker\pi = I\). So \(I\)
contains all nilpotent ideals of \(A\). By Proposition 3.5.3,
\(I = \mathrm{Rad}(A)\).</p>
<p>Returning to the problem, the quotient \(\mathrm{Cl}(V)/I\) is isomorphic
to \(\mathrm{Cl}(V')\) where \(V'\) is the span of \(x_1, \ldots, x_d\); the
restriction of \(\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle\) is then the identity matrix
on \(x_1, \ldots, x_d\), so \(\mathrm{Cl}(V')\) is semisimple.
By the Lemma, \(\mathrm{Rad}(\mathrm{Cl}(V))
= I\) and \(\mathrm{Cl}(V)/\mathrm{Rad}(\mathrm{Cl}(V)) \cong
\mathrm{Cl}(V')\).</p></li>
