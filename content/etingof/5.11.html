<p><em>Remark:</em> The text says to use Frobenius reciprocity, but it seems
obvious that it means we should use the Frobenius formula from section 5.9. One
might wonder which of the three \(\mathbb{Z}_2\)-subgroups of \(S_3\) to use in
(1), and similarly for (2) and (3). However, if we look at the Frobenius
character formula, we see that replacing \(H\) with a conjugate subgroup
doesn't change the result; in (1), the three subgroups of \(G\) isomorphic to
\(\mathbb{Z}_2\) are all conjugate to each other, so we must get the same
decomposition regardless of which one we choose for the computation. A similar
statement holds for (2) and (3)</p>

<p><span class="problem">Problem 5.11.1</span> The group \(A_5\) has the
property that any two isomorphic subgroups are conjugate, so in each of (a) to
(e), all possible induced representations from a subgroup of the given
isomorphism class are isomorphic. In all of the below, let \(G = A_5\). We
assume the ground field is \(\mathbb{C}\).</p>
<ol class="subproblems">
<li><p>We'll set \(H\) to be the subgroup generated by \((1\ 2)(3\ 4)\).
\(H\) has two irreps, which were previously denoted \(\mathbb{C}_+\) and
\(\mathbb{C}_-\). We will also use that notation here. The character of
either of the two possible induced representations vanishes at \(g \in G\)
whenever \(g\) isn't conjugate to any elements of \(H\), namely, when \(g\) is
a 3-cycle or a 5-cycle. By Remark 5.8.3, both induced representations have
dimension 30, so
\(\chi(1) = 30\) in both cases. The double transpositions of \(A_5\) form a
single conjugacy class, so let \(g = (1\ 2)(3\ 4)\); computing
\(\chi(g)\) in \(\Ind^G_H \mathbb{C}_+\) and \(\Ind^G_H \mathbb{C}_-\) will
then complete the calculations of their characters.</p>
<p>In \(\Ind^G_H \mathbb{C}_+\), \(\chi(g)\) is \(1/|H|\) times the order of
the centralizer of \(g\),
since \(g\) is not conjugate to the identity. By the orbit-stabilizer theorem,
the order of the centralizer is the order of \(A_5\) divided by the size of its
conjugacy class, or \(60 \div 15\), where we have used the previously stated
fact that all double transpositions are conjugate to each other. Thus,
\(\chi(g) = 2\) in \(\Ind^G_H \mathbb{C}_+\). In \(\Ind^G_H \mathbb{C}_-\), we
must then have \(\chi(g) = -2\) since \(\chi((1\ 2)(3\ 4)) = -1\) in
\(\mathbb{C}_-\). We therefore have the following characters:</p>

<p>Using orthogonality of characters, we find
\begin{align*}
\Ind^G_H \mathbb{C}_+ &amp;\cong \mathbb{C} \oplus \mathbb{C}^3_+
\oplus \mathbb{C}^3_- \oplus 2\mathbb{C}^4 \oplus 3\mathbb{C}^5 \\
\Ind^G_H \mathbb{C}_- &amp;\cong 2\mathbb{C}^3_+ \oplus 2\mathbb{C}^3_-
\oplus 2\mathbb{C}^4 \oplus 2\mathbb{C}^5
\end{align*}
where we have labelled the irreps of \(A_5\) as they were labelled in section
4.8.</p></li>
<li><p>We'll set \(H\) to be the subgroup generated by \(g = (1\ 2\ 3)\). \(H\)
has three irreps; denote these by \(\mathbb{C}\), \(\mathbb{C}_\omega\),
and \(\mathbb{C}_{\omega^2}\), where \(g\) respectively acts as 1,
\(\omega\), and \(\omega^2\), with \(\omega = \exp(2\pi i/3)\). By Remark
5.8.3, the three induced representations will each have dimension 20, and
therefore \(\chi(1) = 20\). The characters of the double transpositions and
5-cycles will vanish in all three induced representations since such elements
of \(A_5\) are never conjugate to \(g\), a 3-cycle. As all 3-cycles in \(A_5\)
are conjugate to each other, we only need to compute \(\chi(g)\) in each of the
three induced representations in order to fill out the character table.</p>
<p>In \(\Ind^G_H \mathbb{C}\), \(\chi(g)\) will be \(1/|H|\) times the number
of elements of \(G\) that either fix \(g\) under conjugation or take \(g\) to
\(g^2\). By the orbit-stabilizer theorem, since the conjugacy class of \(g\)
contains 20 elements, there are 3 elements that fix \(g\) (namely, the 3
elements of \(H\) itself) and 3 elements that take \(g\) to \(g^2\), namely
\((1\ 2)(4\ 5), (2\ 3)(4\ 5), (3\ 1)(4\ 5)\). Thus, \(\chi(g) = 2\). In
\(\Ind^G_H \mathbb{C}_{\omega}\), the sum in the Frobenius formula of section
5.9 includes \(\omega\) twice and \(\omega^2\) twice, so \(\chi(g) =
(1/3)(3\omega + 3\omega^2) = -1\). In \(\Ind^G_H \mathbb{C}_{\omega^2}\), we
get result, \(\chi(g) = (1/3)(3\omega^2 + 3\omega) = -1\), the same result. We
now write out the characters of the induced representations:</p>

<li><p>Set \(H = \langle g \rangle\) with \(g = (1\ 2\ 3\ 4\ 5)\). Write
\(\zeta = \exp(2\pi i/5)\). There are 5 irreps of \(H\), which we'll denote by
\(\mathbb{C}\) and \(\mathbb{C}_{\zeta^i}\) for \(i = 1, 2, 3, 4\), using
similar notation to that of part (b). The dimension of each induced
representation is 12 and all induced characters vanish for double
transpositions and 3-cycles. The 5-cycles in \(A_5\) split into two conjugacy
classes, one containing \(g\) and \(g^4\), the other containing \(g^2\) and
\(g^3\). Thus, we will need to compute \(\chi(g)\) and \(\chi(g^2)\)
separately for each of the induced representations.</p>
<p>Start with \(\Ind^G_H \mathbb{C}\). The conjugacy class of \(g\) has size
12, so there are 5 elements of \(A_5\) that commute with \(g\), and another 5
that take \(g\) to \(g^4\) under conjugation. Thus \(\chi(g) = (1/5)(5 + 5)
= 2\). Likewise, there are 5 elements that commute with \(g^2\) and another 5
that take \(g^2\) to \(g^3\), so \(\chi(g^2) = 2\) as well. In
\(\Ind^G_H \mathbb{C}_{\zeta}\) and \(\Ind^G_H \mathbb{C}_{\zeta^4}\), we
obtain \(\chi(g) = (1/5)(5\zeta + 5\zeta^4) = 2\cos(2\pi/5) =
\frac{\sqrt{5}-1}{2}\), and \(\chi(g^2) = (1/5)(5\zeta^2 + 5\zeta^3) =
2\cos(4\pi/5) = \frac{-\sqrt{5}-1}{2}\). In \(\Ind^G_H \mathbb{C}_{\zeta^2}\)
and \(\Ind^G_H \mathbb{C}_{\zeta^3}\), we obtain \(\chi(g) = (1/5)(5\zeta^2 +
5(\zeta^2)^4) = \frac{-\sqrt{5}-1}{2}\) and \(\chi(g^2) = (1/5)(5(\zeta^2)^2 +
5(\zeta^2)^3) = \frac{\sqrt{5}-1}{2}\). In tabular format:</p>

<li><p>Let \(H\) be the \(A_4\)-subgroup acting on 1, 2, 3, 4
(<i>i.e.,</i> all elements of \(H\) fix 5). There are 4 irreps of \(A_4\),
which were assigned the names \(\mathbb{C}\), \(\mathbb{C}_{\epsilon}\),
\(\mathbb{C}_{\epsilon^2}\), and \(\mathbb{C}^3\) in section 4.8 and whose
characters were given. In each of the representations \(\mathbb{C}_{\epsilon}\)
and \(\mathbb{C}_{\epsilon^2}\), the elements of the normal \(V_4\)-subgroup of
\(A_4\) act trivially, and some other element \(g = (1\ 2\ 3)\) is then
chosen to act as the scalar \(\epsilon\) or \(\epsilon^2\), respectively (here,
\(\epsilon = \exp(2\pi i/3)\). In the 3-dimensional representation, the
double transpositions have trace &minus;1 while the 3-cycles have trace 0. This
gives us all the information we need to compute the induced characters, which
have dimension \(|A_5|/|A_4| = 5\) when induced from the 1-dimensional
representations of \(H\), and dimension 15 when induced from the 3-dimensional
representation.</p>
<p>As always, the character of \(\Ind^G_H \mathbb{C}\) will be the easiest to
compute. It vanishes at all the 5-cycles, since no 5-cycle can be conjugate to
any element of \(H\). Taking \(g = (1\ 2\ 3)\) as above, there are 3 elements
of \(A_5\) that commute with \(g\) and 3 elements mapping it to each of its
7 conjugates in \(A_4\) (namely, the other 3-cycles in \(A_4\)), so the
Frobenius formula of section 5.9 gives \(\chi(g) = (1/12)(8 \times 3) = 2\).
(The remaining 12 conjugates lie outside \(H\).) Set \(g' = (1\ 2)(3\ 4)\);
there are 4 elements of \(A_5\) that commute with \(g'\), and 4 taking it to
each of its two conjugates in \(A_4\), so \(\chi(g') = (1/12)(4 + 4 + 4) =
1\).</p>
<p>To compute \(\Ind^G_H \mathbb{C}_\epsilon\), we use the fact that \(g\)
belongs to a conjugacy class of \(H\) that contains four 3-cycles, with the
other four 3-cycles belonging to another conjugacy class; but all eight of
these 3-cycles are conjugate to each other in \(A_5\). The sum in the
Frobenius formula of section 5.9 therefore includes 12 terms with value
\(\epsilon\) (since there are 4 elements of \(H\) with trace \(\epsilon\) and 3
elements of \(G\) taking \(g\) to each of these under conjugation) and another
12 with value \(\epsilon^2\), giving \(\chi(g) = (1/12)(12\epsilon +
12\epsilon^2) = -1\). Since all double transpositions have trace 1 in
\(\mathbb{C}_\epsilon\), it follows that \(\chi(g') = 1\) here as in the
previous paragraph. A similar calculation, only exchanging \(\epsilon\) with
\(\epsilon^2\), shows that \(\Ind^G_H \mathbb{C}_{\epsilon^2}\) is isomorphic
to \(\Ind^G_H \mathbb{C}_\epsilon\).</p>
<p>Finally, in \(\Ind^G_H \mathbb{C}^3\), all terms in \(\chi(g)\) vanish since
the 3-cycles are trace-free in \(\mathbb{C}^3\), and the 12 terms in
\(\chi(g')\) each have value \(-1\), so \(\chi(g') = -1\). In tabular form:</p>

<li><p>The Klein four-group can be realized as a subgroup of \(G = A_5\) as
\(H = \{1, x, y, z\}\) where \(x = (1\ 2)(3\ 4)\), \(y = (1\ 3)(2\ 4)\), and
\(z = (1\ 4)(2\ 3)\). By Theorem 5.6.1, all irreps of \(H\) are tensor products
of \(\mathbb{C}_+\) and \(\mathbb{C}_-\); so there are 4 such irreps, each
one-dimensional, and we denote them by \(\mathbb{C}\) (the trivial
representation), the non-trivial \(\mathbb{C}_x\) where \(x\) and the identity
act as the scalar \(+1\) while \(y, z\) act as \(-1\), and the similarly
defined \(\mathbb{C}_y\) and \(\mathbb{C}_z\). The four induced representations
of \(G\) all have dimension 15 and the induced characters must be nonzero only
at the identity and at the double transpositions. In each induced
representation, \(\chi(x) = \chi(y) = \chi(z)\) since they are all conjugate
to each other.</p>
<p>The element \(x\) belongs to a conjugacy class of \(A_5\) of size 15, so its
centralizer has order 4. There are 4 elements of \(A_5\) that, under the
action of conjugation, take \(x\) to each of its conjugates \(y, z\) in \(H\).
Therefore, in \(\Ind^G_H \mathbb{C}\), \(\chi(x) = (1/4)(4 + 4 + 4) = 3\).</p>
<p>When computing \(\chi(x)\) in \(\Ind^G_H \mathbb{C}_x\), we keep in mind
that each
of the 4 elements that commute with \(x\) contributes \(+1\) to the sum, while
each of the 4 elements that take \(x\) to each of \(y\) and \(z\) contributes
\(-1\). Therefore, \(\chi(x) = (1/4)(4 - 4 - 4) = -1\). A similar calculation
shows that \(\chi(x) = -1\) in the representations induced from
\(\mathbb{C}_y\) and \(\mathbb{C}_z\). Thus, we have the following
characters:</p>
