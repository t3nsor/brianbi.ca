<p><span class="problem">Remark</span> The proof of theorem 5.4.4 relies on the
result that the matrices of a finite group representation over \(\mathbb{C}\)
are diagonalizable. This useful fact was never explicitly proven in the text.
The proof is as follows: suppose \(G\) is a finite group, \(g \in G\), and
\(V\) is a complex finite-dimensional representation of \(G\). Then the matrix
\(M = \rho(g)\) satisfies \(M^k = I\) for some positive integer \(k\), so that
\(M^k - I = 0\). The minimal polynomial of \(M\) divides \(x^k - 1\), so it
factors as \((x - \zeta_1) \cdot \ldots \cdot (x - \zeta_m)\) for some distinct
roots of unity \(\zeta_i\). Therefore \(M\) is diagonalizable.</p>

<p><span class="problem">Remark</span> In the proof of Burnside's theorem, it
is asserted that if \(G\) is the smallest nonsolvable group of order \(p^a
q^b\), then \(G\) is simple. To see why, suppose \(G\) were not simple. Then
it would have some nontrivial proper normal subgroup \(H\), and both of the
groups \(H\) and \(G/H\), being smaller than \(G\), must be solvable. But
\(H\) and \(G/H\) being both solvable would imply \(G\) is solvable as well, a
contradiction.</p>
