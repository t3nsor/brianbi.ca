<h2>Section 2.16. Problems on Lie algebras</h2>
<p><span class="problem">Problem 2.16.1</span> Following the Hint, we proceed
by induction in dimension.</p>
<p>If \(\mathfrak{g}\) is one-dimensional, and
\(a \in \mathfrak{g}\) is nonzero, then let \(v \in V\) be an eigenvector of
\(\rho(a)\); the span of \(v\) alone, a one-dimensional subspace of \(V\), is a
one-dimensional subrepresentation of \(V\); so if \(V\) is irreducible then it
must be one-dimensional.</p>
<p>If \(d \geq 2\), assume that the Lie theorem holds for all Lie algebras of
dimension strictly less than \(d\). Let \(\mathfrak{g}\) be a \(d\)-dimensional
solvable Lie algebra. If \(K(\mathfrak{g})\) is trivial, then \(\mathfrak{g}\)
is abelian and the only irreducible representations of \(\mathfrak{g}\) are
one-dimensional, as desired. If \(K(\mathfrak{g})\) is nontrivial, then the
following hold:</p>
<ol>
<li>\(K(\mathfrak{g})\) is a solvable Lie algebra of dimension strictly less
than \(\mathfrak{g}\);</li>
<li>\(Q = \mathfrak{g}/K(\mathfrak{g})\) is an abelian Lie algebra.</li>
</ol>
<p>Applying the inductive hypothesis to \(V\) considered as a representation of
\(K(\mathfrak{g})\), we see that contained within \(V\) is an irreducible
subrepresentation of \(K(\mathfrak{g})\) of dimension one. Let \(v\) be a
nonzero vector belonging to this subrepresentation.
If we define \(\chi: K(\mathfrak{g}) \to \mathbb{C}\) such
that \(av = \chi(a)v\) for each \(a\), then \(\chi\) is a linear function.</p>
<p>Suppose \(x \in \mathfrak{g}\) and \(a \in K(\mathfrak{g})\). Consider the
smallest vector space \(U\) containing \(v\) and invariant under \(x\), that
is, \(\span \{v, xv, x^2v, \ldots\}\). Since \(U\) is finite-dimensional, a
basis for \(U\) is given by \(\{v, xv, \ldots, x^{\dim U - 1}v\}\). If \(n \in
\mathbb{N}\), then
\begin{equation}
a x^n v = x^n a v + [a, x^n]v = \chi(a) x^n v + \chi([a, x^n])v
\label{eqn:2.16.1}
\end{equation}
\((\ref{eqn:2.16.1})\) implies that \(a x^n v \in U\). Since this holds for
any \(a \in K(\mathfrak{g})\), \(U\) is invariant under 
\(K(\mathfrak{g})\). Furthermore, if
\(1 \leq n &lt; \dim U\), then the coefficient of \(x^n v\) in \(a x^n v\) is
\(\chi(a)\), while if \(n = 0\), then the coefficient is again \(\chi(a)\)
since \([a, x^n] = [a, \Id] = 0\). Therefore \(a\) acts with trace
\((\dim U) \chi(a)\) on \(U\). In particular, \(\tr([x, a]) = \tr(xa) -
\tr(ax) = 0\), implying \(0 = \dim(U) \chi([x, a])\), so
\begin{equation*}
\chi([x, a]) = 0
\end{equation*}</p>
<p>Using this result, we find that \(0 = [x, a]v = xav - axv = \chi(a)xv -
axv\), so if \(v\) is a common eigenvector of all \(a \in K(\mathfrak{g})\),
then each \(xv\) is also a common eigenvector of \(K(\mathfrak{g})\). Although
\(xv\) may not necessarily lie in \(\span(v)\), we can consider the subspace
\(W \subseteq V\) such that \(aw = \chi(a)w\) for all \(w \in W\); then \(W\)
is closed under the action of \(\mathfrak{g}\). Now \(Q\) acts linearly on
\(W\) and is abelian, so \(W\) contains some common eigenvector of \(Q\),
which is therefore a common eigenvector of \(\mathfrak{g}\).
Therefore \(V\) can be irreducible only if it is
one-dimensional.</p><div class="qed"></div>
<p><em>(Note from Brian):</em> It's not clear to me whether this solution is
the one intended by the text. The Hint leaves off after <q>show that
\(\mathfrak{g}\) preserves common eigenspaces of \(K(\mathfrak{g})\)</q>.
Taking the quotient \(\mathfrak{g}/K(\mathfrak{g})\) seems to be the
cleanest way to proceed, but is not so obvious. A more common technique
involves applying the inductive hypothesis to an ideal of codimension one, so
there is only one <q>outside</q> element for which an eigenvector needs to be
found.</p>
<p><span class="problem">Problem 2.16.2</span> In the case of characteristic
zero, Lie's theorem applies, and every finite-dimensional irreducible
representation is one-dimensional. It's easy to see that \(Y\) must act as the
zero operator, while \(X\) is any scalar multiple of \(\Id\). There is
therefore one irreducible representation for each element of the ground
field.</p>
<p>We now focus on the case of characteristic \(p &gt; 0\). Use \(L\) to denote
the Lie algebra described in the problem. Let \(V\) be a finite-dimensional
irrep of \(L\) and let \(v\) be an eigenvector of \(x\), so that \(xv =
\lambda v\). Observe that \(x(yv) = yxv + [x, y]v = (\lambda + 1)yv\), that is,
\(yv\) is either zero or an eigenvector with eigenvalue \(\lambda + 1\). If the
sequence \(v, yv, y^2 v, \ldots\) terminates in zero, then we have found a
simultaneous eigenvector of \(x\) and \(y\), and hence a one-dimensional
subrepresentation. So \(V\) itself must be one-dimensional, and consist only
of \(v\), so that \(yv = 0\). So we have found one class of irreducible
representations \(V_\lambda\) of the form \(Y = 0, X = \lambda \Id\) for some
\(\lambda \in k\).</p>
<p>If the sequence does not terminate in zero, note that \(y^p\) is central
(the proof is left as an exercise for the reader),
and if \(V\) is irreducible, then \(y^p\) acts as a scalar in \(V\), so
\(\span\{v, yv, \ldots, y^{p-1}v\}\) is a subrepresentation of \(V\). Since
\(V\) is irreducible, \(V = \span\{v, yv, \ldots, y^{p-1}v\}\). Furthermore,
since \(y^k v\) is an eigenvector of \(x\) with eigenvalue \(\lambda + k\),
the \(y^k v\) (\(0 \leq k \leq p-1\)) have different eigenvalues and are
linearly independent. So they form a basis of \(V\). With respect to this
basis, \(X\) takes the form
\begin{equation*}
X_\lambda = \begin{pmatrix}
\lambda &amp; 0           &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 \\
0       &amp; \lambda + 1 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 \\
\vdots  &amp; \vdots      &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
0       &amp; 0           &amp; \cdots &amp; \lambda + p - 1
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation*}
If \(y^p = c \Id\), and \(\mu\) is the unique \(p\)<sup>th</sup> root of
\(c\), then we can always normalize the eigenvectors of \(X\) so
that \(Y\) takes the form
\begin{equation*}
Y_\mu = \begin{pmatrix}
0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; \mu \\
\mu &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; \mu &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; \mu &amp; 0
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation*}
Clearly different \(c\), and hence \(\mu\), yield nonisomorphic
representations. The only constraint is that \(\mu \neq 0\) in order for the
representation to be irreducible. Two \(\lambda\)'s will yield isomorphic
representations if they differ by \(1 + 1 + \ldots\), otherwise the spectra of
\(X\) will be different so the representations will be nonisomorphic.</p>
<p>So all finite-dimensional irreps of \(L\) are given
by the \(\{V_\lambda \mid \lambda \in k\}\) previously defined, and the
\(\{W_{\lambda,\mu} \mid \lambda \in k/C_p, \mu \in k \setminus \{0\}\}\) given
by \(\{X = X_\lambda, Y = Y_\mu\}\). (The notation \(k/C_p\) means the quotient
with the cyclic group of order \(p\).)
Evidently, the Lie theorem is not true in positive
characteristic.</p>
<p><span class="problem">Problem 2.16.3</span></p>
<ol class="subproblems">
<li><p>One useful fact is that if \(x\) and \(y\) generate a Lie algebra
\(\mathfrak{g}\), and \([x, z] = [y, z] = 0\) for some \(z \in \mathfrak{g}\),
then \([\mathfrak{g}, z] = \{0\}\). This is because the Jacobi identity allows
us to <q>flatten</q> a Lie bracket of the form \([[a, b], c]\) as
\([a, [b, c]] - [b, [a, c]]\). By iterating this process, whatever the form of
\(a \in \mathfrak{g}\), we can flatten out \([a, z]\) into a linear combination
of terms of the form \(\ad(a_1) \ad(a_2) \ldots \ad(a_n) z\) in which
each \(a_i\) is either \(x\) or \(y\), so the result is zero.
(We can formalize this using proof by induction.)</p>
<p>Hence, the Lie algebra \(\mathfrak{g}_1\) can be no more than 3-dimensional
since \([x, [x, y]] = [y, [x, y]] = 0\). To see that it is
exactly 3-dimensional, we consider it as the Lie algebra spanned by
\(e_1, e_2, e_3\) with \([e_1, e_2] = e_3\) and all other Lie brackets zero.
This satisfies the Jacobi identity since all \([a, [b, c]]\) vanish, so it is a
valid Lie algebra.</p>
<p>In \(\mathfrak{g}_2\), \([y, [y, [x, y]]] = 0\) by definition while the
Jacobi identity implies that
\([x, [y, [x, y]]] = [y, [x, [x, y]]] + [[x, y], [x, y]] = 0\)
so \(\mathfrak{g}_2\) can be no more than 4-dimensional. To show that it is
exactly 4-dimensional, we use the same technique as with \(\mathfrak{g}_1\).
Identifying \(e_1, e_2, e_3, e_4\) with \(x, y, [x, y], [y, [x, y]]\),
respectively, we get the Lie brackets
\begin{equation*}
[e_1, e_2] = e_3; \qquad [e_2, e_3] = e_4
\end{equation*}
with all other Lie brackets zero. We only need to check the Jacobi identity
for \([e_2, [e_1, e_2]]\) since this is the only nonzero double Lie bracket.
Indeed \([e_2, [e_1, e_2]] + [e_1, [e_2, e_2]] + [e_2, [e_2, e_1]] = 0\) so
\(\span\{e_1, e_2, e_3, e_4\}\) with these brackets forms a valid Lie
algebra.</p>
<p>In \(\mathfrak{g}_3\), we note that \([x, [y, [x, y]]]\) must still be zero
since the proof of that only used the fact that \(\ad^2(x)(y) = 0\), which
holds also in \(\mathfrak{g}_3\). To continue to explore \(\mathfrak{g}_3\), it
suffices to keep on iterating the application of \(\ad(x)\) or \(\ad(y)\). Now
\([y, [y, [x, y]]]\) is plausibly nonzero. From there we can continue to
\([y, [y, [y, [x, y]]]]\), which is zero by definition, and
\([x, [y, [y, [x, y]]]]\), which is also plausibly nonzero. Using the Jacobi
identity at the outermost level, we can rewrite this in the form:
\begin{equation*}
[x, [y, [y, [x, y]]]] = [y, [x, [y, [x, y]]]] + [[x, y], [y, [x, y]]]
= [[x, y], [y, [x, y]]]
\end{equation*}
since \([x, [y, [x, y]]]\) vanishes.
Beyond that point, a further application of \(\ad(x)\) yields zero, which we
can see by again applying the Jacobi identity at the outermost level:
\begin{align*}
[x, [[x, y], [y, [x, y]]]] = [[x, y], [x, [y, [x, y]]]] + [[x, [x, y]],
[y, [x, y]]] = 0
\end{align*}
since \([x, [y, [x, y]]]\) and \([x, [x, y]]\) both vanish. Finally, the
application of \(\ad(y)\) one final time also yields zero, which we can see by
repeated application of the Jacobi identity:
\begin{align*}
[y, [[x, y], [y, [x, y]]]
&amp;= [[y, [x, y]], [y, [x, y]]] + [[x, y], [y, [y, [x, y]]]] \\
&amp;= [x, [y, [y, [y, [x, y]]]]] - [y, [x, [y, [y, [x, y]]]] \\
&amp;= -[y, [y, [x, [y, [x, y]]]]] - [y, [[x, y], [y, [x, y]]]]
\end{align*}
(where, at each step, we use the fact that the first term on each RHS is zero).
Thus, in characteristic other than 2, \([y, [[x, y], [y, [x, y]]]] = 0\). (In
characteristic 2 it appears this problem has a different answer, but I assume
the ground field is implied to be \(\mathbb{C}\).)</p>
<p>So it appears that a basis of \(\mathfrak{g}_3\) is given by \(x, y, [x, y],
[y, [x, y]], [y, [y, [x, y]]], [[x, y], [y, [x, y]]]\). To prove this, we again
use the same technique as with \(\mathfrak{g}_1\) and \(\mathfrak{g}_2\).
Identifying \(e_1, e_2, e_3, e_4, e_5, e_6\) with the purported basis vectors
in the order previously given, we can compute that the only nonzero Lie
brackets are:
\begin{equation*}
[e_1, e_2] = e_3; \qquad
[e_1, e_5] = e_6; \qquad
[e_2, e_3] = e_4; \qquad
[e_2, e_4] = e_5; \qquad
[e_3, e_4] = e_6;
\end{equation*}
(Note that the Lie brackets [16], [26], [34], [35], [36], [45], [46], and [56]
vanish because they are too <q>deep</q>: by using the Jacobi identity to
flatten out a nested Lie bracket expression with six or more generators, we can
always see that it vanishes based on the work above.) We have to verify that
this is a valid Lie algebra by verifying the Jacobi identity for all double Lie
brackets. The only nonzero ones are \([1[24]], [2[12]], [2[23]], [3[23]]\).
Antisymmetry automatically implies the Jacobi identity if any two of the three
operands are the same. For the case [1[24]], we can easily check that
\begin{equation*}
[e_1, [e_2, e_4]] + [e_2, [e_4, e_1]] + [e_4, [e_1, e_2]] = [e_1, e_5] + 0
+ [e_4, e_3] = e_6 - e_6 = 0
\end{equation*}
so we are done; the dimension of \(\mathfrak{g}_3\) is 6.</p>

<p><span class="problem">Problem 2.16.4</span>
We will use the letter \(K\) to denote the ground field. Let \(V\) be an
irreducible finite-dimensional representation of \(\mathfrak{sl}_2(K)\).
(Etingof has clarified that the problem is intended to be about the
finite-dimensional irreps only, but adds that infinite-dimensional irreps do
not exist here.)</p>
<p>Recall a number of useful facts:</p>
<ol><li>As we know from Problem 2.15.1, if \(v \in V\) is an eigenvector of
\(H\) with eigenvalue \(\lambda\), then \(Ev\) (if nonzero) is an eigenvector
of \(H\) as well, with eigenvalue \(\lambda + 2\), and \(Fv\) (if nonzero) is
an eigenvector of \(H\) with eigenvalue \(\lambda -2\).</li>
<li>We also have some results from parts (a) and (b) of Problem 2.15.1. We
collect them here together with some similar results that can be proven by
induction in a similar way:
\begin{gather}
[H, E^k] = 2k E^k \label{eqn:2.16.4.1} \\
[E^k, F] = k E^{k-1} H + k(k-1) E^{k-1} \label{eqn:2.16.4.2} \\
[H, F^k] = -2k F^k \tag{\ref{eqn:2.15.1b1}} \\
[E, F^k] = kF^{k-1} H - k(k-1) F^{k-1} \tag{\ref{eqn:2.15.1b2}}
\end{gather}</li>
<li>From the above, we immediately see that in characteristic \(p\), the
elements \(E^p\) and \(F^p\) are central.</li>
<li>In part (g), we showed that \(C = EF + FE + H^2/2\) is central. Therefore,
it acts as a scalar in \(V\), say, \(C = c \Id\). If \(v\) is an eigenvector
of \(H\), then using \(Cv = cv\) together with \((EF - FE)v = Hv = \lambda v\),
we obtain that \(EFv\) and \(FEv\) are scalar multiples of \(v\).</li>
</ol>
<p>Since \(V\) is irreducible, we know that \(E^p\) and \(F^p\) both act as
scalars. Note that \(E^p\) being nonzero automatically implies that the
dimension of \(V\) is at least \(p\). To see this, observe that \(E^p\) being
nonzero would imply that \(E\) is nonsingular; and if \(v \in V\) were an
eigenvector of \(H\), the sequence \(v, Ev, \ldots, E^{p-1}v\) would then be a
sequence of eigenvectors of \(H\) with different eigenvalues, so they would be
linearly independent, proving that the dimension is at least \(p\). A similar
argument shows that \(F^p\) being nonzero would imply that
\(\dim V \geq p\).</p>
<p>This allows us to easily classify the irreducible representations of
dimension strictly less than \(p\). For these, both \(E^p\) and \(F^p\) act as
the zero operator on \(V\). Pick some eigenvector of \(H\). By
iterating the action of \(E\) on this eigenvector, we obtain a sequence of
eigenvectors of \(H\) that terminates in zero. So there exist \(v \in V
\setminus \{0\}, \lambda \in K\) with \(Hv = \lambda v, Ev = 0\).
Let \(n\) be the smallest integer such that \(F^n v = 0\). Obviously,
\(n \leq \dim V &lt; p\). The results of 2.15.1(b)&ndash;(f) apply, and the
vectors \(v, Fv, \ldots, F^{n-1}v\) form the basis of a \(n\)-dimensional
irreducible representation of \(\mathfrak{sl}_2(K)\), where \(\lambda
= n -1\), which we may again denote by \(V_\lambda\); and the \(V_\lambda\)
exhaust the irreps of dimension less than \(p\), up to isomorphism.</p>
<p>Now we come to the \(p\)-dimensional or higher irreps (we will see that the
dimension cannot be greater than \(p\)). We begin with the case where
\(\rho(E^p) = a \Id\) with \(a \neq 0\). Let
\(v_0\) be an eigenvector of \(H\) with eigenvalue \(\lambda\) and let
\(v_i = E^i v_0\) for \(i = 1, 2, \ldots, p-1\); then the \(v_i\)'s are all
linearly independent, with \(Hv_i = (\lambda + 2i)v_i\). Obviously,
\(Ev_{p-1} = av_0\). Since \(FEv\) is a scalar multiple of \(v\) for each
\(v \in V\), it follows that \(Fv_i = FEv_{i-1}\) is a scalar multiple of
\(v_{i-1}\) for \(i = 1, 2, \ldots, p-1\) and similarly \(Fv_0
= a^{-1} FEv_{p-1}\) is a scalar multiple of \(v_{p-1}\). So the \(v_i\)'s form
a basis for an invariant subspace of \(V\), which must be \(V\) itself if the
latter is to be irreducible.  Now suppose \(Fv_0 = bv_{p-1}\). Then we can
work out \(Fv_1 = FEv_0 = EFv_0 - Hv_0 = (ab - \lambda) v_0\). Continuing, we
obtain \(Fv_2 = FEv_1 = EFv_1 - Hv_1 = (ab - 2\lambda - 2)v_1\) and so on.
We must check that the commutation relations are also satisfied at the end,
that is, that \((EF - FE)v_{p-1} = Hv_{p-1}\). Luckily, this turns out to be
the case, so we have obtained a valid representation, in which:
\begin{align}
Hv_i &amp;= (\lambda + 2i) v_i \label{eqn:RH} \\
Ev_i &amp;= \begin{cases}
  v_{i+1} &amp; i &lt; p-1 \\
  av_0 &amp; i = p-1
\end{cases} \label{eqn:RE} \\
Fv_i &amp;= \begin{cases}
  bv_{p-1} &amp; i = 0 \\
  (ab - i\lambda - i(i-1)) v_{i-1} &amp; i &gt; 0
\end{cases} \label{eqn:RF} \\
C &amp;= \left[\frac{\lambda^2}{2} - \lambda + 2ab\right]\Id
\end{align}
Denote this representation by \(R(a, b, \lambda)\). If \(R'\) is a
proper subrepresentation of \(R(a, b, \lambda)\), then \(E^p\) must act as the
zero operator on \(R'\) since \(R'\) is less than \(p\)-dimensional. But since
\(E^p\) acts as a nonzero scalar on \(R(a, b, \lambda)\), \(R'\) must be the
zero representation. Therefore all \(R(a, b, \lambda)\) are irreducible.</p>

<p>Obviously any two \(R(a, b, \lambda)\)
with different \(a\) are nonisomorphic. The representations
\(R(a, b_1, \lambda_1), R(a, b_2, \lambda_2)\) where \(\lambda_1 - \lambda_2
\notin \mathbb{F}_p\) are also nonisomorphic as the spectra of \(H\) differ.
However, the representations \(R(a, b, \lambda)\) and \(R(a, b - a^{-1}\lambda,
\lambda + 2)\) are isomorphic. If \(\{v_0, v_1, \ldots, v_{p-1}\}\) is a basis
for \(R(a, b, \lambda)\) satisfying the above relations, and \(\{w_0, w_1,
\ldots, w_{p-1}\}\) is a basis for \(R(a, b - a^{-1}\lambda, \lambda')\)
with \(Hw_0 = \lambda' w_0\) and so on (\(\lambda' = \lambda + 2\)), then an
isomorphism is given by
\begin{equation*}
\phi(v_i) = \begin{cases}
  w_{i-1} &amp; i &gt; 0 \\
  a^{-1} w_{p-1} &amp; i = 0
\end{cases}
\end{equation*}
as can be easily verified. Moreover, in a pair of isomorphic
representations, the Casimir operators must act as the same scalar. This scalar
is linear in \(b\) so it follows
that \(R(a, b, \lambda)\) cannot be isomorphic to \(R(a, b', \lambda + 2)\)
for any \(b'\) other than \(b - a^{-1}\lambda\). Consequently, up to
isomorphism, there is exactly one irrep of the form \(R(a, b, \lambda)\) for
each \(a \in K \setminus \{0\}, b \in K\), and \(\lambda\) the representative
of some element of the quotient group \(K/\mathbb{F}_p\), and all other
representations of the form \(R(a, b, \lambda)\) with \(a \neq 0\) are
isomorphic to one of these.</p>
<p>By considering \(\rho(F^p) = a \Id\) with \(a \neq 0\) instead, we obtain an
analogous set of \(p\)-dimensional irreducible representations
\(S(a, b, \lambda)\) for which
\begin{align}
Hv_i &amp;= (\lambda - 2i) v_i \label{eqn:SH} \\
Ev_i &amp;= \begin{cases}
  bv_{p-1} &amp; i = 0 \\
  (ab + i\lambda - i(i-1)) v_{i-1} &amp; i &gt; 0
\end{cases} \label{eqn:SE} \\
Fv_i &amp;= \begin{cases}
  v_{i+1} &amp; i &lt; p-1 \\
  av_0 &amp; i = p - 1
\end{cases} \label{eqn:SF} \\
C &amp;= \left[\frac{\lambda^2}{2} + \lambda + 2ab\right]\Id
\end{align}
The isomorphism situation is analogous to that of the \(R\)'s: by considering
Casimir invariants we see that all possible isomorphisms between different
\(S\)'s are generated by the isomorphism between \(S(a, b, \lambda)\) and
\(S(a, b + a^{-1}\lambda, \lambda - 2)\).</p>
<p>Note that if in a representation \(S(a, b, \lambda)\) the scalar operator
\(\rho(E^p)\) is nonzero then \(S(a, b, \lambda)\) must be
isomorphic to some \(R(a', b', \lambda')\) since the \(R\)'s comprise all
irreducible \(p\)-dimensional representations where \(\rho(E^p)\) is nonzero.
Therefore the only \(S\)'s that are not isomorphic to any \(R\) are those for
which the product \(b(ab+\lambda)(ab+2\lambda-2) \ldots (ab-\lambda-2)\) is
zero, namely the representations \(S_i(a, \lambda) =
S(a, -ia^{-1}(\lambda-i+1), \lambda)\) where
\(a \in K \setminus \{0\}, \lambda \in K, i \in \{0, 1, \ldots, p-1\}\).</p>
<p>Using the fact that \(S(a, b, \lambda)\) is isomorphic to
\(S(a, b + a^{-1}\lambda, \lambda - 2)\) we obtain that \(S_i(a, \lambda)\) is
isomorphic to \(S_{i-1}(a, \lambda - 2)\). It follows that all the \(S_i\)'s
are isomorphic to some \(S_0\). So we can restrict our attention to the
representations of the form \(S_0(a, \lambda)\). For a given
\(S_0(a, \lambda)\), all isomorphic \(S\)'s are given by
\(\{S_i(a, \lambda+2i) \mid i \in \{1, 2, \ldots, p-1\}\}\) since these are the
representations generated by the isomorphism previously noted between
\(S(a, b, \lambda)\) and \(S(a, b + a^{-1}\lambda, \lambda-2)\). Therefore
an isomorphism exists between \(S(a, 0, \lambda)\) and \(S(a, 0,
\lambda + 2i)\) if and only if \(S(a, 0, \lambda + 2i) = S_i(a, \lambda +
2i)\), that is, if \(0 = -ia^{-1}(\lambda + 2i - i + 1)\), which is solved to
obtain \(i = 0\) or \(\lambda = -i-1\). Therefore for each \(a \in K \setminus
\{0\}\), the only isomorphisms between different \(S(a, 0, \lambda)\)s are
those between \(S(a, 0, -i-1)\) and \(S(a, 0, i-1)\) for each \(i \in
\mathbb{F}_p\). These partition the \(S(a, 0, i)\)s into the isomorphism
classes \(\{\{p-1\}, \{0, p-2\}, \{1, p-3\}, \ldots,
\{(p-3)/2, (p-1)/2\}\}\) with respect to \(i\).</p>
<p>Finally, it falls to us to consider any remaining representations (dimension
\(p\) or greater)
for which both \(E^p\) and \(F^p\) act as the zero operator. In such a
representation, we can always find a common eigenvector of \(H\) and \(E\),
that is, some \(v_0 \neq 0, \lambda\) with \(Ev_0 = 0, Hv_0 = \lambda v_0\).
Writing \(v_i = F^i v_0\), and applying reasoning similar to that which we
previously considered when \(F^p\) was nonzero, we obtain that \(\{v_0, v_1,
\ldots, v_{p-1}\}\) form a basis for \(V\) and that \(Ev_i =
(i\lambda - i(i-1))v_{i-1}\) for each \(i = 1, 2, \ldots, p-1\). Thus:
\begin{align*}
Hv_i &amp;= (\lambda - 2i)v_i \\
Ev_i &amp;= \begin{cases}
0 &amp; i = 0 \\
(i\lambda-i(i-1))v_{i-1} &amp; i &gt; 0
\end{cases} \\
Fv_i &amp;= \begin{cases}
v_{i+1} &amp; i &lt; p - 1 \\
0 &amp; i = p - 1
\end{cases}
\end{align*}
Note that this can be regarded as \(S(0, 0, \lambda)\).
No two such representations can be isomorphic to each other since in
\(S(0, 0, \lambda)\), we can uniquely determine \(\lambda\) using the fact
that the unique eigenvector of \(F\) has the eigenvalue \(\lambda + 2\) with
respect to \(H\). Note however that not all \(S(0, 0, \lambda)\)'s are
irreducible. For \(\lambda \notin \mathbb{F}_p\) every nonzero
vector is cyclic since we can iterate \(F\) until we are left with a multiple
of \(v_{p-1}\) and then iterate \(E\) repeatedly to generate a basis, but for
\(\lambda \in \{0, 1, \ldots, p-2\}\) the subspace spanned by
\(\{v_{\lambda+1}, v_{\lambda+2}, \ldots, v_{\lambda+p-1}\}\) is invariant. For
\(\lambda = p-1\), the representation \(S(0, 0, \lambda)\) is isomorphic to
\(V_{p-1}\).</p>
<p>In conclusion, all nonisomorphic irreducible
representations of \(\mathfrak{sl}_2(K)\) are given by:</p>

<li>The \(n\)-dimensional representation \(V_{n - 1}\) for each

<p>There are no irreducible representations of dimension greater than
\(p\).</p>
<p><span class="problem">Problem 2.16.5</span>
Etingof has clarified that this problem was intended to only be about the
finite-dimensional irreps (but adds that there are no infinite-dimensional
irreps). This problem turns out to be very similar to Problem 2.16.4, so some
similar techniques will be abbreviated in this solution.</p>
<p>First consider the case with \(q\) not a root of unity. Suppose \(V\) is an
irreducible finite-dimensional representation of
\(\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{sl}(2))\). Let \(v\) be an eigenvector of
\(\rho(K)\) be an eigenvector of \(K\) with eigenvalue \(\lambda\). Then
\(K(ev) = \lambda Ke (K^{-1}v) = \lambda q^2 ev\), therefore \(ev\), if
nonzero, is another eigenvector of \(\rho(K)\) with eigenvalue \(q^2\lambda\).
Likewise, \(fv\) is either zero or an eigenvector of \(\rho(K)\) with
eigenvalue \(q^{-2}\lambda\). By starting with some eigenvector of \(\rho(K)\)
and iterating the action of \(e\), we must always eventually reach zero (we
cannot get an infinite number of eigenvectors of \(\rho(K)\) all with different
eigenvalues).</p>
<p>So there is some \(v \in V\) that satisfies \(Hv = \lambda v, ev = 0,
v \neq 0\). The sequence \(v, fv, f^2 v, \ldots\) must likewise terminate in
zero. Suppose \(f^{n-1} v \neq 0\) and \(f^n v = 0\). Then we claim that
\(\{v, fv, \ldots, f^{n-1}v\}\) span an invariant subspace (and hence form a
basis of \(V\)). To do so it suffices to show that \(ef^i v\) is a scalar
multiple of \(f^{i-1} v\) for each \(i = 1, 2, \ldots, n-1\). This can be done
by induction:</p>
<ol>
<li>For \(i = 1\), \(ef^i v = efv = fev + [e, f]v = [e, f]v\) which is a scalar
multiple of \(v\) since \(v\) is an eigenvector of \(\rho(K)\).</li>
<li>For \(i &gt; 1\), \(ef^i v = ef(f^{i-1}v) = fe(f^{i-1}v) +
[e, f](f^{i-1}v) = f(af^{i-2}v) + bf^{i-1}v = (a + b)f^{i-1}v\) where the
scalar \(a\) is guaranteed to exist by the inductive hypothesis and \(b\) by
the fact that \(f^{i-1}v\) is an eigenvector of \(\rho(K)\).</li>
</ol>
<p>Therefore, if \(N = \dim V\) and \(v_i\) denotes \(f^i v\) then
\begin{align*}
Kv_i &amp;= q^{-2i}\lambda v_i \\
fv_i &amp;= \begin{cases}
v_{i+1} &amp; i &lt; N-1 \\
0 &amp; i = N-1
\end{cases} \\
ev_i &amp;= \begin{cases}
0 &amp; i = 0 \\
\frac{v_{i-1}}{q-q^{-1}} \sum_{j=0}^{i-1} (q^{-2j}\lambda -
q^{2j} \lambda^{-1})
&amp; i &gt; 0
\end{cases}
\end{align*}
where the expression for \(ev_i\) has been obtained by induction using the
commutation relation for \(e, f\). Taking this one step further and setting
\(0 = efv_{N-1} = fev_{N-1} + [e,f]v_{N-1}\) yields the relation
\begin{equation*}
0 = \sum_{j=0}^N (q^{-2j}\lambda - q^{2j}\lambda^{-1})
\end{equation*}
which can be rearranged to yield \(\lambda^2 = q^{2N-2}\), therefore
\(\lambda = \pm q^{N-1}\). Using this value of \(\lambda\) with the above
relations and doing some algebra, we obtain
\begin{align}
Kv_i &amp;= \pm q^{N-2i-1} v_i \label{eqn:Kq1} \\
fv_i &amp;= \begin{cases}
v_{i+1} &amp; i &lt; N-1 \\
0 &amp; i = N-1
\end{cases} \label{eqn:fq1} \\
ev_i &amp;= \begin{cases}
0 &amp; i = 0 \\
\pm \frac{v_{i-1}}{(q-q^{-1})^2} [q^N + q^{-N} - q^{N-2i} - q^{-N+2i}]
&amp; i &gt; 0 \label{eqn:eq1}
\end{cases}
\end{align}
Call the representations obtained by the two choices of sign \(V^+_{q,N}\) and
\(V^-_{q,N}\). It is straightforward but tedious to verify that they are valid
representations. To see that they are irreducible, note that we can start with
any nonzero vector, iterate \(f\) repeatedly until we get a multiple of
\(v_{N-1}\), then iterate \(e\) repeatedly to regenerate the basis. This latter
procedure must work because \(q^N + q^{-N} - q^{N-2i} - q^{-N+2i}\) can't be
zero unless \(q^{2i} = 1\) or \(q^{2(N-i)} = 1\), neither of which is possible
for any \(0 &lt; i &lt; N\) unless \(q\) is a root of unity. Since \(v_0\) is
the only eigenvector of \(\rho(K)\) that is annihilated by \(e\), and this
eigenvector has two different eigenvalues in \(V^+_{q,N}\) and \(V^-_{q,N}\),
these two irreps are nonisomorphic. So for \(q\) not a root of unity, there
is a countably infinite series of finite-dimensional irreducible
representations \(V^\pm_{q,N}\), two of each positive dimension \(N\).</p>
<p>Consider now the case where \(q\) is a root of unity. Let \(M\) be the
smallest positive integer such that \(q^{2M} = 1\). Suppose \(1 \leq N &lt;
M\) and let \(V\) be an irrep of dimension \(N\).
Suppose \(v \in V\) is an eigenvector of \(\rho(K)\).
It must be the case that \(e^N v = 0\). For if this were
not the case, then the vectors \(v, ev, \ldots, e^N v\) would have \(N+1\)
distinct eigenvalues, which is a contradiction. Thus, we can always find some
nonzero \(v_0 \in V\) with \(Kv_0 = \lambda v_0, ev_0 = 0\). As before, if
\(v_i = f^i v\) with \(v_n = 0, v_{n-1} \neq 0\), then \(\{v_0, \ldots,
v_{n-1}\}\) form a basis of an invariant subspace of \(V\), hence a basis of
\(V\). So \(n = N\) and the basis is \(\{v_0, \ldots, v_{N-1}\}\) and the
action of the generators is given by \((\ref{eqn:Kq1})\) through
\((\ref{eqn:eq1})\), in other words, we have the two nonisomorphic irreps
\(V^\pm_{q,N}\) where, as before, \(\lambda = \pm q^{N-1}\).</p>
<p>Now consider \(N \geq M\). Observe that \(Ke^M K^{-1} = (KeK^{-1})^M
= (q^2 e)^M = q^{2M} e^M = e^M\). Likewise \(Kf^M K^{-1} = f^M\).
Furthermore \(K\) commutes with \(fe\) and hence shares a common eigenvector
with it. We will
also make use of the following results:</p>
<p><em>Lemma 1:</em> For each positive integer \(i\), \(Ke^i = q^{2i}e^i K\)
and \(e^i K^{-1} = q^{2i} K^{-1} e^i\).</p>
<p><em>Proof:</em> Note that the defining relations imply \(Ke = q^2 eK\) and
\(eK^{-1} = q^2 K^{-1}e\). The desired result immediately follows.
</p><div class="qed"></div>
<p><em>Lemma 2:</em> For each positive integer \(i\),
\begin{equation*}
[e^i, f] = \frac{1 - q^{2i}}{(1-q^2)(q-q^{-1})} (e^{i-1}K - K^{-1}e^{i-1})
\end{equation*}</p>
<p><em>Proof:</em> By induction. For \(i = 1\) this follows immediately from
the defining relation for \([e,f]\). For \(i &gt; 1\), write
\([e^i, f] = e[e^{i-1}f] + [e,f]e^{i-1}\) and apply the inductive
hypothesis.</p><div class="qed"></div>
<p><em>Corollary:</em> \([e^M, f] = 0\). Together with the fact that
\(Ke^M K^{-1} = e^M\), this implies that \(e^M\) is central.</p>
<p>Since \(e^M\) is central, it follows that in the irrep \(V\), it acts as a
scalar. First assume this scalar is a nonzero value \(a\). Therefore if \(v_0\)
is some common eigenvector of \(\rho(K)\) and \(\rho(fe)\), and
\(v_i = e^i v_0\), then the vectors
\(v_0, v_1, \ldots, v_{M-1}\) have distinct eigenvalues with respect to \(K\),
and therefore form a basis of a subspace invariant under \(e\) and \(K\).
We claim that it is invariant under \(f\) as well, which is proven by
induction:</p>
<ol>
<li>\(fv_1 = fev_0\) is a scalar multiple of \(v_0\) since \(v_0\) was assumed
an eigenvector of \(\rho(fe)\).</li>
<li>For \(2 \leq i &lt; M\), we have that \(fv_i = fev_{i-1} =
efv_{i-1} - [e,f]v_{i-1}\) which is a scalar multiple of \(v_{i-1}\) by the
inductive hypothesis and the relation for \([e,f]\).</li>
<li>Furthermore, \(fv_0 = a^{-1}fev_{M-1} = a^{-1}(efv_{M-1} - [e,f]v_{M-1})\)
which is similarly a scalar multiple of \(v_{M-1}\).</li>
</ol>
<p>Therefore \(V\) is precisely \(M\)-dimensional with basis \(\{v_0, v_1,
\ldots, v_{M-1}\}\). Let \(b \in k\) be such that \(fv_0 = bv_{M-1}\) and let
\(\lambda\) be the eigenvalue of \(v_0\) with respect to \(K\). Then, by using
Lemma 2 to compute \(fe^i v_0\), we obtain:
\begin{align}
Kv_i &amp;= q^{2i} \lambda v_i \label{eqn:KqR} \\
ev_i &amp;= \begin{cases}
v_{i+1} &amp; i &lt; M - 1 \\
av_0 &amp; i = M - 1
\end{cases} \label{eqn:eqR} \\
fv_i &amp;= \begin{cases}
bv_{M-1} &amp; i = 0 \\
\left[ab - \frac{(1-q^{2i})(\lambda - q^{-2i+2}\lambda^{-1})}
{(1-q^2)(q-q^{-1})}\right] v_{i-1} &amp; i &gt; 0
\end{cases} \label{eqn:fqR}
\end{align}
This turns out to be a valid representation for any \(\lambda \neq 0\) (we omit
some algebra). We call this representation \(R(a,b,\lambda)\). If \(R'\) is a
proper subrepresentation of \(R(a,b,\lambda)\), then \(e^M\) must act as the
zero operator on \(R'\) since \(R'\) is less than \(M\)-dimensional. But since
\(e^M\) acts as a nonzero scalar on \(R(a,b,\lambda)\), \(R'\) must be the
zero representation. Therefore all \(R(a,b,\lambda)\) are irreducible.</p>
<p>To investigate isomorphisms we will use the quadratic Casimir element for
\(\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{sl}(2))\)
[<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-th/9402017.pdf">Kerler, 1995</a>]:
\begin{equation}
C = ef + \frac{qK^{-1} + q^{-1}K}{(q-q^{-1})^2}
\end{equation}
The element \(C\) is central, so it acts as a scalar in an irrep. For
\(R(a,b,\lambda)\) that scalar is given by \(c = ab + (q\lambda^{-1} +
q^{-1}\lambda)/(q-q^{-1})^2\), which is linear in \(b\). Now two \(R\)'s can
only be isomorphic when they have equal \(a\) and the ratio of their
\(\lambda\)'s is a power of \(q^2\) (to ensure that the spectra are equal).
Because the scalar \(c\) is linear in \(b\), it's not possible for
\(R(a,b,\lambda)\) to be isomorphic to \(R(a,b',\lambda)\) unless \(b = b'\).
Indeed, by equating \(c\) between \(R(a,b,\lambda)\) and \(R(a,b',
q^2\lambda)\) we see that the only possible isomorphism must be obtained by
setting \(b' = b - a^{-1}(\lambda - \lambda^{-1})/(q - q^{-1})\). Explicitly,
the isomorphism between \(R(a, b, \lambda)\) and \(R(a, b', q^2\lambda)\) is
given by
\begin{equation*}
\phi(v_i)  = \begin{cases} a^{-1} w_{M-1} &amp; i = 0 \\
w_{i-1} &amp; i &gt; 0
\end{cases}
\end{equation*}
where \(\{v_0, \ldots, v_{N-1}\}\) and \(\{w_0, \ldots, w_{N-1}\}\) are 
respectively bases of \(R(a,b,\lambda)\) and \(R(a, b', q^2\lambda)\)
satisfying Eqns \((\ref{eqn:KqR})\) through \((\ref{eqn:fqR})\). It is
straightforward but tedious to verify that \(\phi\) is indeed an isomorphism.
So all nonisomorphic \(R\)'s are given by
\(\{R(a, b, \lambda) \mid a \in k \setminus \{0\}, b \in k,
\lambda \in k/\langle q^2\rangle\}\).</p>
<p>As in Problem 2.16.4, we can likewise investigate \(M\)-dimensional irreps
where \(\rho(f^M) = a \Id\) with \(a \neq 0\). We omit a lot of analogous
calculations here, observing only that it suffices to swap \(e\) and \(f\) and
replace \(q\) by its inverse in the calculations above. This gives irreducible
representations with basis \(\{v_0, \ldots, v_{M-1}\}\) parametrized by
\(b, \lambda \in k\) where
\begin{align}
Kv_i &amp;= q^{-2i} \lambda v_i \label{eqn:KqS} \\
fv_i &amp;= \begin{cases}
v_{i+1} &amp; i &lt; M-1 \\
av_0 &amp; i = M-1
\end{cases} \label{eqn:fqS} \\
ev_i &amp;= \begin{cases}
bv_{M-1} &amp; i = 0 \\
\left[ab + \frac{(1 - q^{-2i})(\lambda - q^{2i-2}\lambda^{-1})}
{(1 - q^{-2})(q - q^{-1})}\right] v_{i-1} &amp; i &gt; 0
\end{cases} \label{eqn:eqS} \\
Cv_i &amp;= \left[ab + \frac{q\lambda + q^{-1}\lambda^{-1}}{(q-q^{-1})^2}
\right] v_i
\end{align}
We shall denote this representation by \(S(a, b, \lambda)\); it can be
verified that
\begin{equation}
S(a, b, \lambda) \cong S(a, b + a^{-1}(\lambda - \lambda^{-1})/(q-q^{-1}),
q^{-2}\lambda) \label{eqn:Siso}
\end{equation}
where the \(\cong\) symbol denotes isomorphism; and that (since the Casimir
invariant is linear in \(b\)) this isomorphism generates all isomorphisms
between different \(S\)'s.</p>
<p>Now, any \(S(a, b, \lambda)\) in which \(\rho(e^M)\) is nonzero must be
isomorphic to one of the \(R\)'s, so we consider only those where
\(\rho(e^M) = 0\). For these, one of the coefficients in \((\ref{eqn:eqS})\)
must vanish, therefore these representations are given by
\begin{equation*}
S_i(a, \lambda) = S\left(a, -\frac{a^{-1}(1-q^{-2i})(\lambda -
q^{2i-2} \lambda^{-1})}{(1-q^{-2})(q-q^{-1})}, \lambda\right)
\end{equation*}
for some \(i \in \{0, 1, \ldots, M-1\}\). With a bit of algebra, we can show
that \((\ref{eqn:Siso})\) is equivalent to the statement that
\(S_i(a, \lambda)\) is isomorphic to \(S_{i-1}(a, q^{-2}\lambda)\) for all
\(i \in \{0, 1, \ldots, M-1\}\). Therefore all \(S_i\)'s can be put
into isomorphism with some \(S_0(a, \lambda) = S(a, 0, \lambda)\), and for a
given \(S_0(a, \lambda)\), all isomorphic \(S\)'s are given by
\(\{S_i(a, q^{2i}\lambda) \mid i \in \{1, 2, \ldots, M-1\}\}\). An isomorphism
between \(S(a, 0, \lambda)\) and \(S(a, 0, q^{2i} \lambda)\) with
\(i \in \{1, 2, \ldots, M-1\}\) will therefore occur if and only if
\(S(a, 0, q^{2i} \lambda) = S_i(a, q^{2i}\lambda)\), that is, when
\begin{equation*}
0 = -\frac{a^{-1} (1 - q^{-2i})(q^{2i}\lambda -
q^{2i-2} q^{-2i} \lambda^{-1})}{(1-q^{-2})(q-q^{-1})}
\end{equation*}
which implies \(q^{2i} = 1\) or \(\lambda = \pm q^{-i-1}\). By definition of
\(M\), the former cannot happen. So all the isomorphisms between different
\(S_0\)'s are those between \(S(a, 0, \pm q^{-i-1})\) and \(S(a, 0,
\pm q^{i-1})\) for \(i \in \mathbb{Z}\). For example, if \(M\) is odd and \(q\)
is a primitive \(M\)<sup>th</sup> root of unity, then all pairs of isomorphic
\(S_0\)'s are given by \(\{S(a, 0, q^0), S(a, 0, q^{M-2})\}, \{S(a, 0, q^1),
S(a, 0, q^{M-3})\}, \ldots, \{S(a, 0, q^{(M-3)/2}), S(a, 0, q^{(M-1)/2})\}\),
and similarly with each \(q^i\) replaced by \(-q^i\). We will skip the explicit
construction of the isomorphism classes for the other cases (\(M\) odd with
\(q\) a primitive \(2M\)<sup>th</sup> root of unity, or \(M\) even).</p>
<p>We now turn our attention to \(M\)-dimensional representations in which
both \(e^M\) and \(f^M\) act as the zero operator. We proceed in a similar
manner as in Problem 2.16.4, starting with \(v_0\) a common eigenvector of
\(\rho(K)\) and \(\rho(e)\) with eigenvalues \(\lambda\) and 0, respectively,
and writing \(v_i = f^i v_0\). The resulting representation is then
\(S(0, 0, \lambda)\) for some \(\lambda \neq 0\). No two such representations
can be isomorphic since in \(S(0, 0, \lambda)\) we can uniquely determine
\(\lambda\) using the fact that the unique eigenvector of \(\rho(f)\) has
the eigenvalue \(q^2\lambda\) with respect to \(K\). However, some of these
representations are not irreducible, namely precisely those in which the
coefficient in \((\ref{eqn:eqS})\) vanishes for some \(1 \leq i \leq M-1\).
Using some algebra we see that this happens when \(\lambda = \pm q^{i-1}\).</p>
<p>In conclusion, the nonisomorphic irreducible representations are given
by:</p>
<ul>
<li>The \(N\)-dimensional representations \(V^\pm_{q,N}\), where
\(1 \leq N &lt; M\), as defined by \((\ref{eqn:Kq1})\) through

<li>The \(M\)-dimensional representation \(R(a,b,\lambda)\) for each

\(i \in \mathbb{Z}\), the representations \(S(a, 0, q^{-i-1})\) and
\(S(a, 0, q^{i-1})\) are isomorphic, and the representations
\(S(a, 0, -q^{-i-1})\) and \(S(a, 0, -q^{i-1})\) are isomorphic;</li>
<li>The \(M\)-dimensional representations \(S(0, 0, \lambda)\) for each
