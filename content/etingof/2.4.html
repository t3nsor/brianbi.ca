<h2>Section 2.4. Ideals</h2>
<p><span class="problem">Problem 2.4.1</span> Let \(I_1 \subseteq I_2
\subseteq \ldots\) be a chain of proper ideals. Such a chain has an upper bound
given by \(I = \bigcup_i I_i\). It is easy to verify that \(I\) is an ideal.
 Since none of the \(I_i\) contains the unit,
neither does \(I\), so it is also proper. This establishes that every chain of
proper ideals has an upper bound which is a proper ideal. By Zorn's lemma, there
is a maximal ideal. This holds for left, right, and two-sided ideals.</p>
