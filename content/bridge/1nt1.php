<h2>The 1NT opening bid</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
The vast majority of partnerships use 1NT as a natural bid, showing a
balanced or semi-balanced hand. A <em>balanced</em> hand is one that has shape
4333, 4432, or 5332. A semi-balanced hand can also have a 5422 or 6322 shape. It
used to be common to use 1NT only for balanced hands. However, it was found that
1NT opening bids are extremely useful because bidding sequences that start with
a 1NT opening are able to communicate information more precisely than most other
types of bidding sequences. In addition, opening 1NT makes it difficult for
opponents to interfere. For this reason, newer players generally have no qualms
about opening semi-balanced hands with 1NT. But just because it is acceptable to
open a hand 1NT does not mean 1NT is necessarily the best bid. One might wish to
open with 1 of a suit instead, for reasons that we will discuss below.
</p>
<p>
In some cases, one might wish to open 1NT despite having a singleton. In 2016,
ACBL approved a change to the General Convention Chart, making it legal to open
1NT with a 4441, 5431, or 6331 shape at all levels of tournament play; however,
the singleton must be an ace, king, or queen. (It is not common to open 1NT with
a 6331 shape. Opening 1NT with a 4441 or 5431 shape is common as it helps to
avoid certain rebid problems. We will discuss these below.) A partnership
agreement that involves 1NT openings outside the parameters of the ACBL General
Convention Chart is still perfectly legal under the rules of bridge, but such an
agreement may not be permitted in some tournaments.
</p>
<p>
In contrast to a 1-level suit opening, which shows anywhere from 12 to 21
points, the 1NT opening is usually narrow. The most common partnership agreement
is 15&ndash;17 points, but among newer players, a sizeable minority play a
<q>weak notrump</q> opening, which is usually 12&ndash;14 points. The reason for
this is as follows. When you have a suit to show, but especially a major suit,
it is important to show it as soon as possible, because if the opponents
interfere, you might no longer have a bid available to show your suit. On the
other hand, when the opponents bid, notrump contracts become less attractive for
your side. So we are not in a hurry to show a notrump-ish hand. We reserve the
1NT opening for a narrow point range, and use other sequences to show
notrump-ish hands with other point ranges. That way, when partner sees your 1NT
bid, they will have precise information about your hand. This site uses the
following common point ranges:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Open 1 of a suit, then rebid 1NT: 12&ndash;14 points</li>
<li>Open 1NT: 15&ndash;17 points</li>
<li>Open 1 of a suit, then rebid 2NT: 18&ndash;19 points</li>
<li>Open 2NT: 20&ndash;21 points</li>
<li>Open 2C, then rebid 2NT: 22&ndash;24 points</li>
</ul>
<p>
Because of widespread variance in 1NT opening point ranges, the ACBL requires a
player to make an announcement whenever their partner opens 1NT. For example,
if your partnership agreement is that a 1NT opening shows 15 to 17 points, then
when your partner opens 1NT, you must, immediately and without prompting,
announce <q>15 to 17</q>. Other notrump bids listed above do not require
announcements.
</p>
<h3>The value of 1NT openings</h3>
<p>
The value of opening 1NT goes beyond the mere fact that it provides a precise
description of opener's hand. Experts have constructed a system of responses and
rebids to 1NT that also allow the responder to accurately describe
<em>their</em> hand. Moreover, after a <q>strong</q> 1NT opening bid (such as
one that shows 15&ndash;17 points), such systems enable opener to become
declarer most of the time, which keeps the stronger hand hidden from opponents'
view, which puts opponents at a disadvantage when defending.
</p>
<p>
However, there is one particular advantage of a 1NT opening that will be
relevant below. When you open 1 of a suit, occasionally you might hear a
response from partner that will leave you with a dilemma about what to do next.
Experts say that we should never make a bid unless we have a plan as to what our
next bid will be. To be more precise, whenever you make a bid, you should be
prepared for all possible responses from your partner (except responses that
would violate the partnership agreement, or would have a logically impossible
meaning under the partnership agreement). If some possible responses from your
partner would leave you stuck for a rebid, then it might mean that the bid you
are contemplating making now is not the best choice. On the other hand, if you
open 1NT, you will almost never have rebid problems. We won't discuss responses
and rebids for 1NT openings in this section, but we will discuss some examples
of rebid problems that can occur when you open 1 of a suit.
</p>
<h3>When to open 1NT with a balanced or semi-balanced hand</h3>
<p>
In this subsection, we will assume that the opener holds 15&ndash;17 points and
is trying to decide whether to open with 1NT.
</p>
<p>
A hand that has either a 4333 or 4432 shape should always be opened 1NT. It is
simply the most descriptive bid available. If you instead choose to open 1C or
1D, your partner will know that you have 12&ndash;21 points and may or may not
be unbalanced. Clearly, the 1NT bid, which shows 15&ndash;17 points and a
balanced or semi-balanced hand, gives more information.
</p>
<p>
A hand that has 5332 shape should sometimes be opened 1NT. If the 5-card holding
is in a minor suit, then a 1NT opening is usually appropriate: we often prefer
to play in notrump rather than a minor suit, and the precise point range of the
1NT opening helps responder determine whether a 3NT game is in the cards. But if
the 5-card holding is in a major suit, then opinions are divided as to whether
1M or 1NT is a more appropriate opening bid. If the major suit is not bid
immediately by opener, a 5&ndash;3 fit might be missed. Some partnerships have
conventions such as <q>puppet Stayman</q> (which we will discuss later) so that
they can open 1NT with a 5-card major and still find a 5&ndash;3 fit, but some
partnerships eschew puppet Stayman because it gives away too much information to
the opponents. It is important for partnerships to discuss whether or not they
will make 1NT opening bids with 5-card majors.
</p>
<p>
With 5422 shape, a primary consideration in whether to open 1NT or 1 of a suit
is whether opener has a plan as to what they will bid next if their partner does
not support their suit. For example, holding
<?=rsh('QT', 'QT84', 'AKJT4', 'K9')?>, suppose that you chose to open with 1D.
If your partner bids 1H, great; a fit has been found and you should proceed to
show support. But what if your partner bids 1S? You don't have support for
spades, and your partner has skipped over hearts, denying a 4-card heart
holding. If you were to rebid 1NT, your partner would think you have 12&ndash;14
points. By misleading partner as to your strength, you could cause your side to
miss a game. In order to avoid this outcome, you might wish to open this hand
1NT instead. On the other hand, if your 5-card suit is higher-ranking than your
4-card suit, you can open with your 5-card suit, and if your partner does not
show support, you can bid your 4-card suit at the 2 level later, as discussed in
<a href="/bridge/2resp">a previous section</a>. This approach
has the advantage that you get your main suit out there as soon as possible,
which is particularly valuable when it is a major suit. Hands with a 4=5=2=2
distribution (meaning exactly 4 spades, 5 hearts, and 2 in each minor) are a
pickle: it would be nice to show the heart suit, but you will be in a bind if
your partner responds 1NT, forcing you to make a second bid. If you bid 2S, and
your partner can't support spades, you may be forcing them to make another bid
that will take the bidding too high. One might wish to open this hand shape 1NT.
Some partnerships also use a special convention known as <em>Flannery</em>,
which uses 2D as an artificial bid meaning exactly 5 hearts and 4 spades.
</p>
<p>
Hands with a 6332 shape are almost never opened 1NT when the 6-card suit is a
major, because if the major suit is not shown immediately, then even when the
opponents are silent, you will probably not be able to find a 6&ndash;2 or even
6&ndash;3 fit that might exist. When the 6-card suit is a minor, a 1NT opening
is sometimes used to avoid rebid problems. Suppose you hold
<?=rsh('K9', 'AK9', 'QT5432', 'KJ5')?>. If you open 1D and your partner responds
1S, you could rebid 2D, but it somewhat understates the strength of your hand.
Often, a hand that is too strong for a 2D rebid is worthy of a 3D rebid
instead, but in this case, a 3D rebid is dubious, because your diamond suit is
not good. If your partner doesn't have diamond support (say, they have a
singleton), 3D might be too high a contract. You might wish to open this hand
1NT instead. If partner has less than 8 points, they will usually just pass,
which avoids forcing the partnership higher than necessary.
</p>
<h3>When to open 1NT with a singleton</h3>
<p>
The 5431 hand shape may pose similar rebid issues as the 5422 hand shape. If the
5-card suit is higher-ranking than the 4-card suit, the player will most often
bid their 5-card suit first, and, if necessary, bid their 4-card suit at the 2
level on their second bid. However, if the 4-card suit is higher-ranking, then
bidding the 5-card suit first might leave opener stuck for a bid later, unable
to show their second suit. The following is an example of a hand that one might
wish to open 1NT:
<?=ch('K', 'AQ95', 'KJT52', 'QT6')?>
Opening 1NT, instead of 1D, avoids an awkward issue of what to do next if
partner responds 1S to 1D. Note, however, that if the singleton is a low card,
then you should probably try to find a different bid. For example, consider the
following similar hand:
<?=ch('2', 'AQ95', 'KJT52', 'KQT')?>
Opening 1NT with this hand is not permitted by the ACBL General Convention
Chart, even though it is legal under the rules of bridge. Because there are no
good options here, one should look for the least bad option. If you open 1D and
partner responds 1S, you might consider bidding 2C, despite having only 3 clubs
rather than the 4 that you would usually have for such a rebid. Lying about the
length of a minor suit is often the least bad among a set of bad options, and
at least your 3-card club suit is of good quality. With a good diamond suit and
a poor club suit, it might be justified to rebid diamonds despite having only
five.
</p>
<p>
The dreaded 4441 hand shape, which occurs about 3% of the time, is notoriously
difficult to describe. Here is an example of a hand for which a 1NT opening
might be the most accurate description:
<?=ch('KJ42', 'KJ53', 'A', 'KQ73')?>
However, choosing to open this hand 1C is not disastrous, either. If partner
responds 1NT, then opener can bid 2NT to invite to game.
</p>
<h3>Summary of this section</h3>
<ul>
<li>
A 1NT opening shows 15&ndash;17 points and a balanced or semi-balanced hand. In
some cases a 1NT opening might even be made with a singleton, but only if the
singleton is an ace, king, or queen.
</li>
<li>
When a player makes a 1NT opening bid, their partner must announce the point
range defined for 1NT opening bids in the partnership agreement.
</li>
<li>
A hand that could be opened 1NT can also be opened 1 of a suit. Depending on the
details of the hand, 1NT might be a superior choice as it precisely delineates
opener's strength and avoids rebid problems. However, many partnerships
disfavour 1NT openings when opener holds a 5-card major.
</li>
</ul>
