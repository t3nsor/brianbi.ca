<h2>Subsequent bidding at the one level</h2>
<h3>Communicating the strength of your hand</h3>
<p>If your partner has opened at the one-level, you know that their hand
satisfies the Rule of 20. This, in fact, implies that your partner's hand is
worth at least 12 total points&mdash;roughly half of the amount needed for a
game. Of course, it's possible that your partner has a lot more than 12 points,
but that information isn't yet available to you at this point.</p>
<p>This is not a coincidence. In <a href="bridge/1open">the previous
section</a>, we discussed how, in a good bidding system, all hands with at least
half the strength needed for game must be opened. Both of you started out
wondering whether the partnership had enough strength for a game; according to
the agreement, if either partner has at least half of that amount, they should
<q>make the first move</q>, if their partner hasn't already done so. This kind
of pattern resurfaces repeatedly in bidding systems.</p>
<p>Now, when you find yourself opposite a partner who has opened 1 of a
suit&mdash;showing 12+ total points&mdash;it'll often be the case that your own
hand contains 13+ total points and you know that the auction is destined for a
game. The 2/1 system contains a special category of bids that are to be used in
such a situation, in order to make sure your partner understands that the
partnership must keep bidding until a game contract is reached (otherwise you
may miss out on a game). These are called <em>game-forcing bids</em>. In the
2/1 system, certain 2-level responses to 1-level opening bids are game-forcing
(hence the name). We will cover 2/1 game forcing auctions in a later
section.</p>
<p>When your partner has opened but you have less than 13 total points in your
hand, you don't immediately know whether or not the partnership has enough
strength for game. If your agreement were to always pass with less than 13, it
would mean games would be missed as well. (For example, if your partner has 16
total points, then you only need to have 9 in order to bid a game.) If your
agreement were to always respond, then your partner, seeing your response,
wouldn't know if you have 0 or 12 points or anything in between. Here, again,
the principle of making a move if you have half of what's required is relevant.
Your partner has shown at least 12 points; that means that your hand strength
plus whatever undisclosed additional strength your partner has must be at least
13 points in order to go to game. If your hand contains 6 or more total points
(about half of 13) then you should respond in order to keep the auction open
and let your partner know your strength.</p>
<p>To recap, once your partner has opened, 12 points are accounted for; to go to
game, 13 additional points are needed, which can come from both your hand and
your partner's hand. <strong>If you have at least half of that&mdash;6+ total
points&mdash;you should respond. If you have the entire amount&mdash;13+ total
points&mdash;there are special bids available to show that.</strong></p>
<h3>Finding the right strain</h3>
<p>When your partner has opened 1 of a suit, and you've decided that you have to
respond, it means you either know that the partnership has enough strength for
game (because you have 13+ total points), or you are still <em>hoping</em> that
the partnership has enough strength for game (because you have 6&ndash;12 total
points). Assuming you do end up in a game&mdash;usually 3NT, 4&hearts;, or
4&spades;&mdash;how can your bidding agreement help you end up making the right
choice of strain? (A <em>strain</em> means either a suit or notrump. For
example, 2&hearts; and 2NT are two contracts of the same level but different
strains; 2NT and 3NT are two contracts of the same strain but different
levels.)</p>
<p>Suppose your hand is:
<?=ch('Q2', 'A94', 'AT2', 'KT987')?>
and you see your partner open 1&diams;. Then, seeing that your hand contains
13 HCP, you can immediately bid 3NT, which is a game. Your partner will probably
pass, and you'll be declaring 3NT.</p>
<p>Why is 3NT the best game for this deal? Recall that usually we prefer to bid
4M if a 8-card major fit exists, and 3NT otherwise. Given the hand above, if
your partner has opened 1&diams;, they've denied a 5-card major. Since your
partner has less than 5 hearts and less than 5 spades, it's impossible for you
and your partner to have an 8-card major fit. So that makes 3NT probably the
best choice.</p>
<p>However, it's not always that obvious. Suppose again that your partner opens
1&diams;, but this time, your hand is:
<?=ch('Q2', 'A942', 'AT', 'KT987')?>
Now, it's possible that 4&hearts; would be the best contract for you to play
in, but you don't know yet, because you don't know whether your partner has 4
hearts. Thus, jumping immediately to 3NT is not a good choice; you ideally
would like a way to decide between 3NT and 4&hearts;, depending on whether your
partner has 4 hearts or not.</p>
<p>Similarly, your partner may open 1&diams; and you may have the following
hand:
<?=ch('62', 'A942', 'K7', 'JT987')?>
Now what? You don't have 13+ points, so you don't know whether a game is
possible. In this case, you and your partner, through subsequent bidding, have
to establish both whether or not you have 25+ total points together,
<em>and</em> whether there's an 8-card heart fit.</p>
<p>Thus, in these situations, bidding systems provide some way for you to make
a bid that conveys information about your suit distribution to your partner
on your first response (and possibly subsequent responses as well). For
example, most players would bid 1&hearts; in response to their partner's
1&diams; opening, with either of the two hands above, in order to show a
4+-card heart holding. These bids are <strong>forcing</strong>, so that you can
go ahead and make that bid no matter how strong your hand is. Your partner is
obligated to not pass&mdash;so that the possibility of bidding a game is left
open.</p>
<h3>Responding with 1 of a suit</h3>
<p>In light of the previous discussion, most partnerships agree that
<strong>bidding a new suit at the 1-level is forcing.</strong> So, if your
partner opens, and you respond 1X (meaning 1 of a suit), your partner is, under
the partnership agreement, obligated to bid again. Likewise, if your partner
opens, you respond 1X, then your partner bids 1Y (a different suit), you are
obligated to bid again. This forcing agreement guarantees
that, if you want to bid a new suit at the 1-level as part of a process of
determining the best game to bid, then your partner will not pass prematurely.
You will definitely get another chance to bid.</p>
<p>Furthermore, most partnerships that play a 5-card major system agree that
<strong>bidding a new suit at the 1-level shows a 4+ card holding.</strong> The
reason for this has to do with the fact that the most important information
about you and your partner's suit distribution is whether a 8-card major fit
exists, and therefore, bidding agreements are tailored toward making it possible
to determine this. The 5-card major agreement already gives you and your
partner a way of finding 5&ndash;3 fits (opener has 5, responder has 3); the
agreement to bid 4+ card suits at the 1-level gives you and your partner a way
of finding 4&ndash;4 fits.</p>
<p>Let's consider a few situations. First, suppose that your partner has opened
1&diams; and your hand is:
<?=ch('42', '8643', 'KQJ4', '652')?>
Then, you should bid 1&hearts;, showing a 4+-card holding. The fact that you
also have 4+ diamonds is not as important. The fact that the diamond suit is
stronger than the heart suit also doesn't matter. The priority should be to
determine whether a 4&ndash;4 heart fit exists between your hands.</p>
<p>In a similar vein, suppose that you have the same hand:
<?=ch('42', '8643', 'KQJ4', '652')?>
but this time, your partner opens 1&clubs;. Then, again, you should bid
1&hearts;. If you were to bid 1&diams;, you would correctly inform your partner
that you have 4+ diamonds, but it's more important to show the heart suit than
the diamond suit. Many partnerships play <q>up the line</q> bidding, where the
responder would bid 1&diams; first and then the opener would have the chance to
bid 1&hearts; (if opener had 4 hearts), at which point the 4&ndash;4 fit would
be found. The problem with bidding up the line is that when your partner opens
1&clubs;, your right-hand opponent passes, and you bid 1&diams;, your left-hand
opponent might make a bid, and now your partner doesn't have the chance to bid
1&hearts; anymore, so both of you could be left unaware of a 4&ndash;4 heart
fit. If you bid 1&hearts; instead of 1&diams;, you're conveying the most crucial
information to your partner while you still have a chance.</p>
<p>Now let's rearrange the suits a bit. Suppose you hold:
<?=ch('652', '42', '8643', 'KQJ4')?>
and your partner opens 1&hearts;. You have two four-card suits, but
it's not possible to bid either of them at the 1-level, because hearts is
higher (you cannot bid 1m; after someone else has already bid 1&hearts;).
Do not bid 2&clubs; or 2&diams;. A 2-level bid has a different meaning from a
1-level bid. Instead, you have to bid 1NT. This tells your partner that: you
don't have 3 hearts (to support their 5+ hearts), nor do you have a higher
4-card suit to bid, therefore, there probably is no 5&ndash;3 or 4&ndash;4
major fit to be found.</p>
<p>What if your partner opens 1&clubs;, and you have the following hand?
<?=ch('K942', '8764', 'K862', '3')?>
You probably have figured out by now that in our system, you shouldn't bid
1&diams;, because the major suits are more important. But should you bid
1&hearts;, or 1&spades;? This is one case where you <em>should</em> bid up the
line, by bidding 1&hearts; first. The reason for this is that your partner could
have 4 hearts, 4 spades, or both, and since both of them are major suits, they
are both equally important. So you don't want to <q>skip</q> hearts. If you were
to skip hearts by bidding 1&spades;, but it actually turned out that your
partner had 4 hearts, then the 4&ndash;4 heart fit would be missed.</p>
<p>You bid 1&hearts;. If your partner does have 4 hearts, they will make a bid
to communicate the fit (we'll cover this in <a href="bridge/support-major">the
next section</a>). If not, but they do have 4 spades, they'll bid 1&spades; and
now you have a chance to communicate the fit. If they don't have 4 of either
major suit, they'll bid 1NT and you'll know that no major fit exists.</p>

<h3>Bidding 1NT</h3>
<p>As discussed in the previous subsection, 1X bids made by opener or
responder after the opening bid (X means a suit) show 4+ cards in the suit and
are aimed at finding a 4&ndash;4 major. You shouldn't bid 1NT as long as you
still have a higher 4-card suit to bid <em>or</em> you found a major suit
agreement with your partner. However, when neither of those conditions are true,
then you can bid 1NT. For example, if you have the following hand:
<?=ch('42', '8643', 'KQJ4', '652')?>
and your partner opens 1&spades;, then you should bid 1NT. But if your partner
had opened 1&hearts; and you had the above hand, you should not bid 1NT, because
you would need to make a bid that showed agreement with hearts (we will discuss
major suit agreement in <a href="bridge/support-major">the next
section</a>).</p>
<p>Again, suppose you hold the same hand:
<?=ch('42', '8643', 'KQJ4', '652')?>
and this time your partner opens 1&clubs;. As discussed in the previous
subsection, your response should be 1&hearts;. If your partner then bids
1&spades;, it means they don't have 4 hearts, but they do have 4 spades.
However, you don't have 4 spades, so you've exhausted the possibilities of a
major fit, and you bid 1NT.</p>
<p>The opener can also bid 1NT. For example, suppose you hold:
<?=ch('K85', 'A76', 'A6', 'K9852')?>
and you are dealer. You would open 1&clubs;. If your partner were to then
respond with 1&hearts;, you can neither show agreement (since you have less than
4 hearts) nor bid spades (since you have less than 4 spades). So you would bid
1NT.</p>
<h3>Summary of this section</h3>
<p>When the opener bids 1 of a major, their partner knows that they have 5 or
more of that major suit. If the partner has 3 or more of that suit, then a
8-card fit has been found.</p>
<p>If a 5&ndash;3 fit cannot be found in this way, the opener might still have
4 of a major. That is, there might still be a major suit such that the opener
and the responder both have 4. In order to find such a fit, opener and responder
take turns bidding major suits <q>up the line</q>, that is, you keep bidding
the cheapest available 4-card major holding you have at the 1 level, until
either you have a fit for your partner's major, or you have no 4-card majors
left.</p>
To summarize, the rules are:
<ul>
<li>The opener's hand contains at least 12 total points. If your partner opened,
only respond with at least 6 points. With less than 6 points, pass.</li>
<li>Regardless of whether you're the opener or the responder, if you
<em>can</em> support your partner's major suit (<em>i.e.,</em> you know that
you and your partner together have 8+) then make a bid that shows support. (We
discuss how to do this in the next section.</li>
<li>If you can't support your partner's major suit, then regardless of whether
you're the opener or responder, look for a major suit you can bid at the 1
level (4+-card holding), and bid it. If you have both 4+ hearts and 4+ spades,
bid hearts before spades.</li>
<li>Either opener and responder can bid 1NT once they have no 4-card major suits
left to show their partner. However, the 1NT bid should only be used by a player
with a <q>minimal</q> hand, that is, a hand that is near the minimum requirement
to bid. Therefore, a responder with 12 points (much more than the 6 needed to
respond) shouldn't bid 1NT. An opener with 18 points also shouldn't bid 1NT. We
will discuss alternatives in later sections.</li>
</ul>
<p>You might be wondering what happens if opener has 3 of a major suit
and you have 5, rather than the other way around. Like, say, your partner opens
1m, but actually they have 3 hearts, and you have 5 hearts. This situation is
quite common, but so far the system we've discussed is not very useful in this
situation: you will bid 1&hearts;, but your partner won't know that you have 5,
so they won't be able to support hearts right away. Are there bidding
agreements that can enable the two of you to reach a heart contract? The answer
is yes, but this is an advanced topic that we'll discuss later.</p>
