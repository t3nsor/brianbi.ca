<h2>Hand evaluation</h2>
<h3>High card points (HCP)</h3>
The most basic technique for evaluating your hand is to give yourself:
<ul>
<li>4 points for each ace;</li>
<li>3 points for each king;</li>
<li>2 points for each queen;</li>
<li>1 points for each jack.</li>
</ul>
These are called <em>high card points,</em> or <q>HCP</q> for short. There are
40 HCP in a deck.
<h3>Distribution points</h3>
<p>However, we should understand that there is also an advantage to having
imbalanced hands. If you have &hearts;AQxx and your partner has
&hearts;KJxx, so that you have all 10 HCP of the hearts suit, then you can
probably take 4 tricks by leading hearts. (The <q>x</q> represents a card whose
value is too small to be significant.)
However, if you have &hearts;AKQxxx and your partner has &hearts;Jx, then you
can often take up to 6 hearts tricks together: after 4 tricks have been won
with the ace, king, queen, and jack, the opponents will usually have no hearts
left, which means the remaining two small hearts in your hand can each win a
trick. Thus we see that there is an advantage to having a <em>long</em> suit,
beyond just having lots of HCP.</p>
<p>When you are playing in a suit contract, there is an advantage to having
<em>short</em> suits, because once one hand is voided of a suit, it can start
playing trumps. For example, &hearts;A854 opposite &hearts;K932 is probably
only worth 2 tricks, but &hearts;AK9854 opposite &hearts;32 is likely worth
more than 2 tricks (though probably not a full 6 since you may run out of
trumps). Being short in a suit is not helpful in notrump, though. So as a
general rule, we <strong>add points for length in notrump, and add points for
shortness in a suit contract</strong>. These are called <em>distribution
points</em>. Of course, being short in the trump suit
is not a good thing since it implies the opponents have more trumps, so don't
add points for being short in the trump suit.</p>
Usually distribution points are added according to the following rules:
<ul>
<li>Before a suit fit has been found, or if you are planning on being in
notrump, give yourself 1 point for each 5-card suit, 2 points for each
6-card suit, 3 points for a 7-card suit, and so on.</li>
<li>Once a suit fit has been found, take away the length points, and instead
give yourself 1 point for each doubleton suit, 2 points for each singleton
suit, and 3 points for each void suit. (This does not apply to the trump
suit.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Actually, when you are in a suit contract, short suits and long suits
<em>both</em> help you. Consider again the example of &hearts;AKQxxx opposite
&hearts;Jx, with spades as the trump suit this time. You probably can take 6
tricks in hearts without even ruffing, and in fact, will be able to discard
losers from the hand with shorter hearts. Despite this fact, you must remember
(at this stage) not to count both length and shortness points in a suit
contract; only count shortness points. There are some more advanced evaluation
systems in which both length and shortness are counted, but we won't get into
those here.</p>
<p>The sum of HCP and distribution points is called <q>total points</q> or
often just <q>points</q>. Again, in a suit contract, total points equals HCP
plus shortness points, whereas in a notrump contract, total points equals HCP
plus length points.</p>
<h3>The significance of points</h3>
<p>Bridge is a game of taking <em>tricks</em>. The bottom line is that it is
the number of tricks you take, not the number of <em>points</em> you and your
partner have in your hands, that determines your score. The points system is
not a <em>rule</em> of bridge; it is just a way to estimate how many tricks you
and your partner will be able to take.</p>
<p>The number of points you have is not necessarily <em>proportional</em> to
the number of tricks you can take. For example, most of the time, if you and
your partner have at least 25 HCP together, it is possible to make a 3NT
contract (<i>i.e.</i>, take at least 9 tricks out of 13). That is, you can
usually take 69% of the tricks with only 62% of the HCP.
That's partially because the declarer has the ability to coordinate play between
their hand and the dummy hand, thus making their HCP count for more by using
them strategically. By the way, your partnership's HCP are usually worth more
when they are evenly split between you and your partner's hand. For example, if
you have 13 HCP and your partner has 12, there is a 59% chance that you can make
3NT, but if you have 20 HCP and your partner has 5, then your chances drop to
51%. <a href="https://taigabridge.net/articles/dd/hcpsplit.htm">(Source)</a></p>
<p>There are many other reasons as well why not all 25-point pairs of hands are alike. Experienced players
understand that proper evaluation of your hand&mdash;that is, making accurate
estimates of its trick-taking ability&mdash;requires more than just adding up
points. However, the subtleties of hand evaluation can only be learned through
a great deal of bridge experience. Thus, beginners will have to rely on adding
up points for now but should pay attention to finer details of hand evaluation
as they play.</p>
