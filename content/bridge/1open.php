<h2>Opening bidding at the one level</h2>
<h3>Strength needed for an opening bid</h3>
<p>It is important that you open every hand with 13+ HCP. That is, if your hand
has 13+ HCP, it's your turn, and no one else has bid yet, you should bid. The
reason for this is that if you have 13+ HCP and your partner also has 13+ HCP,
then there is probably a game contract that you can make on the current deal.
(Recall that the threshold for making a 4M or 3NT contract is around 25+ total
points, so if each of you has 13+ HCP, you'll have 26+ total points before even
counting distribution points.) If both of you pass with 13 HCP, the opponents
will probably pass as well, and you'll get a score of zero for the board rather
than a positive score from bidding and making a game.</p>
<p>There is no rule in bridge that says a hand with 13+ HCP must be opened. I
a just saying that if you and your partner had an agreement that only hands
with 14+ HCP would be opened, you would be shooting yourselves in the foot.
You have the freedom to make that kind of agreement, but you shouldn't. You
should have agreements that maximize your chances of getting as many points as
possible. So, you and your partner <em>should</em> have an agreement on how
much strength warrants an opening bid, and you <em>should not</em> set the
threshold to be higher than 13 HCP.</p>
<p>You <em>could</em> have an agreement that any hand would be opened, no
matter how weak. However, this would also be a bad idea. Suppose for example
that you have 4 HCP. The expected number of HCP that each of the other three
players has is then 12. So on average, you and your partner will have 16 HCP
together. With 16 HCP, there's probably no contract that you can make. So
whenever your opponents have good hands, they'll double you and you'll lose a
few hundred points. Not a wise system to use.</p>
<p>Besides that, the wider the point range is for a bid, the less information
the bid conveys. If you could open both very weak and very strong hands, then
your partner, upon seeing your bid, would know nothing about your hand
strength! On the other hand, if you have a system where only 13+ HCP hands are
opened, then either an opening bid or pass would tell your partner something
about your hand. A bid would tell your partner that you have 13+ HCP while a
pass would tell them that you have 12&minus; HCP. The more information you and
your partner can exchange during a typical auction, the better you'll be at
finding the right contract and maximizing your score.</p>
<p>You might be thinking, <q>what if my hand is weak but I want to give my
partner information about distribution?</q> But usually you needn't be in a
hurry. Pass, and wait for your partner to open. Then, you'll have an opportunity
to respond. When you respond, your partner will know that you didn't have enough
strength to open, but they'll also have information about your distribution that
you'll convey with your response.</p>
<p>With all that being said, most players nowadays use the <strong>Rule of
20</strong>, which states that you can open if the sum of your HCP count and
the lengths of your two longest suits is at least 20. For example, with 12 HCP
and a 4432 distribution, you can open. If you forget the rule of 20, just
remember to open with 13 <em>total</em> points or more. (Remember to count
points for length rather than shortness, since you haven't found a fit yet.)
The Rule of 20 is a way of taking distribution into account. In the
<a href="/bridge/hand-evaluation">hand evaluation section</a>,
we discussed how distributional hands have more trick-taking potential
than flat hands. So if your hand has good distribution, even with less than 13
HCP, you might want to open it. The Rule of 20 is an agreement that tends to
work well, so that you and your partner will open hands that provide roughly
half of the trick-taking potential needed to make a game. We will use the Rule
of 20 for the remainder of this page.</p>
<h3>Choice of suit to open</h3>
<p>As previously discussed, most partnerships use the Rule of 20 to decide
when to make an opening bid. But, assuming you have a hand that is strong
enough to open, which suit should you bid? Here, already, there is more variety
between partnerships.</p>
<p>The most natural agreement you might have with your partner is to simply open
whichever suit you have the longest holding in. For example, with 4 spades and
3 of each other suit, and 13 HCP, you could open 1&spades;. However, most
partnerships don't use that kind of system. The reason is that the four suits
are not all equally important. Finding a 8-card major fit, if possible, is very
important for maximizing your score. So your bidding system should make it a
priority to communicate information about your major suit holdings. The mere
fact that a minor suit holding happens to be longer than a major suit holding
does not make it more important.</p>
<p>The 2/1 system (as well as Standard American, incidentally) is a
<q>5 card major</q> system, which means that you and your partner agree that
an opening bid of 1M shows a 5+ card holding in that major. Thus, when playing
2/1, if you see your partner open 1&spades;, and you yourself hold at least 3
spades, you immediately know that a 8-card spade fit has been found. On the
other hand, if you hold 3 spades and you see your partner open 1&clubs;, you
immediately know that your partner has 4 or fewer spades, so you and your
partner do not have an 8-card spade fit. This is where the value of the 5 card
major agreement lies: <strong>it provides the most important information up
front, to help you determine whether an 8-card major fit exists.</strong> This
is a theme that will recur again and again. Don't view the set of agreements
that constitute the 2/1 system as merely something to memorize. If you and
your partner never knew that the 2/1 system existed, but you simply played a
lot of hands together using the <q>open your longest suit</q> agreement, you
would gradually discover that this would cause you to miss a lot of 8-card
major fits, reducing your score. You would eventually design something like the
5 card major agreement, and you would never forget it because you would remember
how it was necessary in order to solve the problem of finding 8-card major
fits.</p>
<p>If you have opening strength but no five-card major, then choose the longer
of your two minor suits to open with. If you have opening strength and 5+ cards
in <em>both</em> majors, usually you should bid 1&spades; unless your heart
holding is even longer. We will discuss the reasons for this later. Also note
that the 1NT opening bid is a special case, which we will cover later.</p>
<h3>4-card major systems</h3>
<p>The vast majority of American partnerships use a 5-card major system similar
to the one that we will be using. However, in some countries, 4-card major
systems are more common. The ACOL system, popular in England, is a 4-card major
system. At risk of stating the obvious, a 4-card major system conveys different
information from a 5-card major system:</p>
<ul>
<li>As previously mentioned, in a 5-card major system, when you see your partner
open 1M, and you have 3 cards in that major, you immediately know that a 8-card
fit exists. In a 4-card major system, if you see your partner open 1M, and you
have 3 cards in that major, you don't know whether a 8-card fit exists yet.
Perhaps your partner has 5 of their major, but since the <em>bid</em> only
conveys the information that they have 4+, you need further bidding to explore
whether a fit exists.</li>
<li>In a 5-card major system, when you see your partner open 1m, and you have a
4-card major, you don't know whether a 8-card fit exists yet; perhaps your
partner has 4 cards in your major, yet was not able to open that major,
according to your agreement. Further bidding is required to determine whether
a 4&ndash;4 fit exists in that suit. On the other hand, in a 4-card major
system, your partner wouldd bid their 4-card major right away and you'd
immediately know that a 8-card fit exists.</li>
</ul>
<p>We thus see that 5-card major and 4-card major systems each have advantages
and disadvantages. We will use a 5-card major system, but not because it is
clearly better than a 4-card major system. On the other hand, almost no one
would play a 6-card major system, because such a system would not be efficient
at discovering either 4&ndash;4 or 5&ndash;3 major fits. Sure, it would be
great at finding 6&ndash;2 or 6&ndash;3 major fits, but those are much rarer. A
bidding system that's great at describing rare situations, but not very good at
common situations, will not lead to great scores in the average case.
Similarly, a 3-card major system would only be good at describing hands where
you <em>don't</em> have a 3-card major holding: those rare hands where you have
less than 3 cards in both major suit holdings. In hands where you do have a
3-card major, opening it would leave your partner wondering whether you actually
have 3, 4, or 5+ of your major suit. In other words, in the most typical case,
it would give a very imprecise description, which would not be very helpful for
finding a 8-card major fit and scoring as many points as possible.</p>
<h3>Examples</h3>
What opening bid should be made with the following hands? That is, if you are
dealt the following hands, and everyone before you has passed, what should be
your call?<br/>
<span class="handWrapper">
<?=rh('75', 'AK97', 'A62', 'Q973')?>
<?=rh('AK', 'KJT98', 'AQJ3', 'T4')?>
<?=rh('863', 'AK753', '72', 'JT4')?>
<?=rh('A42', 'QT92', 'QJ9', 'A72')?>
</span>
<p>The first hand should be opened 1&clubs; since it contains no 5-card major
holding, and clubs is the longer of the two minor suits.</p>
<p>The second hand should be opened 1&hearts; since it contains a 5-card heart
holding. After you open 1&hearts;, if your partner has 3+ hearts, they will
immediately know that a 8-card heart fit has been found.</p>
<p>The third hand should not be opened, since it's too weak. It contains 8 HCP,
its longest holding has 5 cards, and the second longest has 3 cards. The sum is
16, which is much less than the threshold of 20 required to open.</p>
<p>The fourth hand should be opened 1&clubs; (if you picked 1&diams;, that's
also an acceptable answer.) Even though you only have 3 of each minor suit, you
must bid a minor suit because there is no 5-card major for you to bid. Thus,
if you see your partner open 1m, keep in mind that they might only have a 3-card
holding in that minor suit. However, most of the time, we don't care that much
about our partner's minor suit holdings; major suits are much more important.
We will see in <a href="/bridge/1resp">the next section</a> how, even when your
partner opens 1m, you may still find a 8-card <em>major</em> fit. Once an
8-card major fit is found, you almost always want to play a contract in that
major suit.</p>
