<h2>Basic principles of bidding systems</h2>
<p>Bidding is the most difficult topic for beginning bridge players to learn.
This was not always the case. In the first half of the 20th century, bridge was
a casual game, popular first among socialites, and later the broader American
population, reaching the peak of its popularity in the 1940s. Over the years,
other activities replaced bridge as a vehicle for young people to socialize.
The popularity of bridge, though much less now than at its peak, endures
because of its vast strategic depth, which has hooked generation after
generation of young people with a particular disposition. Each generation
brought new strategic innovations, some of which withstood the test of time and
became <i>de rigueur</i> for the next generation learning to play bridge.
Consequently, it is common to sit in a random seat on <em>Bridge Base
Online</em> and discover that your partner's profile contains two dozen code
words like <q>supX, invm, fsf, nmf, j2nt</q> and so on. There is a good reason
for this, but it is not possible for beginners to learn all these conventions
at once, particularly when they don't even understand the fundamental
principles of bidding. There is just too much to memorize!</p>
<p>This page aims to explain both the principles and objectives of bidding, and
the particular conventions that arise under them, including the reasoning for
each, in a manner that should be easy for the logically-minded beginner to
understand. My hope is that learning the system described on this page doesn't
feel like memorization. Instead, it should feel like reading a story about how
people used logical reasoning to design a bidding system that would work well
in a wide variety of situations.</p>
<h3>Terminology</h3>
<p>During the auction, players take turns making <em>calls</em>. If your call
is a contract (such as 1NT), then you are making a <em>bid</em>. The other
three possible calls are <q>pass</q>, <q>double</q>, and <q>redouble</q>. The
first call in an auction other than <q>pass</q> is called the <em>opening
bid</em>. If your partner opens and you then make a bid, you are said to be
<em>responding</em>; your partner is opener and you are responder. After that,
if the opener bids again, they are making a <em>rebid</em>; same for the
responder.</p>
<p>If you or your partner opens, but then one of the opponents then makes a bid,
they are said to be <em>overcalling</em>. A bid usually has a different meaning
as an overcall than it does as an opening. More generally, the meaning of a
call depends on the entire context of the preceding calls in the auction, so it
is important to pay attention and particularly to distinguish between opening
bids and overcalls! Besides overcalling, it's also possible that one of the
opponents will double after you or your partner opens. The first opponent to
either overcall or double after your side opens is called the
<em>intervenor</em>. If the intervenor's partner subsequently bids, doubles, or
redoubles, they are the <em>advancer</em>.</p>
<p>An <em>honor</em> card is a card that is 10 or higher. A card that is 9 or
lower is called a <em>spot</em> card. The set of cards that you have in a
particular suit in your hand is called a <em>holding</em>. Therefore, a hand
always consists of four holdings (if you are void in a suit, the holding is the
empty set). The set of four hands dealt to you and the other players is called a
<em>deal</em>. Sometimes a deal is also called a <em>board</em>.</p>
<h3>Natural and artificial bids</h3>
<p>In the early days of contract bridge, bidding was easy to understand because
most bids had roughly the meaning that you would expect: if someone bid a suit,
it meant they had length in that suit and usually meant they were interested in
playing in that suit; bidding showed more strength than passing; bidding higher
showed more strength than bidding lower; double meant you expected the
opponents to go down; redouble meant you expected to make the contract even
though the opponents doubled you. This is called <q>natural</q> bidding.</p>
<p>On the opposite extreme, in the 21st century, it is common for players to
bid a suit when the information they are communicating actually has nothing to
do with their holding in that suit! For example, a very common convention, which
we will discuss later, involves bidding 2&hearts; in order to tell your partner
that your hand contains 5+ <em>spades</em>. This is called an <q>artificial</q>
bid. A double or redouble that does not have its natural meaning can also be
thought of as an artificial call.</p>
<p>All partnerships use natural bids, and most partnerships also have several
agreements to use artificial bids. A particular agreement about the meaning of
an artificial bid, and what subsequent bids after the artificial bid mean, is
called a <em>convention</em>. For example, the <em>Stayman convention</em> is
an agreement between partners that when one partner opens 1NT and the other
responds 2&clubs;, the responder has some 4-card major holding and is asking
the opener if they also have a 4-card major holding. Assuming that a partnership
has agreed to use the Stayman convention, the opener in this situation is
obligated to bid 2&hearts; or 2&spades; if they have a 4+ card major holding,
or 2&diams; if they don't. The Stayman convention therefore entails not only a
specific meaning for this 2&clubs; bid, but also a specific meaning for the
subsequent artificial bid of 2&diams; or the subsequent natural-ish bids of
2M. (The vast majority of partnerships use the Stayman convention. We will cover
it in detail in a later section, so don't bother trying to memorize it
now.)</p>
<p>In most conventions, an artificial call is <em>forcing</em>, which means that
the partner of the player who makes the artifical call is forbidden to pass
(they are <em>forced</em> to bid). Some natural bids are also forcing. We will
discuss the reasons for this later.</p>
<h3>Bidding agreements</h3>
<p>Regardless of whether your bids are natural or artificial, it is crucial
that you and your partner share a common understanding of what each bid means.
What exactly that understanding <em>is</em>, though, is up to the two of
you! The set of such agreements that you and your partner have about the
meanings of bids is called your <em>system</em>. In tournaments, you and your
partner will write down your system on a <em>convention card</em> so that your
opponents will also be able to understand your bids.</p>
<p>For example, a very common agreement used by partnerships in the United
States and Canada is that an opening bid of 1M means the opener has at least
<em>five</em> cards in the suit bid. However, this is not universal, and some =
partnerships have an agreement that this would only promise at least
<em>four</em> cards in the suit. Imagine that your bridge partner were someone
you never met before, and you didn't discuss what such a 1M bid means.
Your partner could bid 1M, you could think it meant five, look at your own hand
and see 3 cards in that major, and mistakenly believe that a 8-card fit exists,
when in actual fact your partner may only have 4 cards in the major suit. This
would cause some serious problems. Thus, we can see that even if you and your
partner don't use any conventions, you still need to have agreements about the
meanings of natural bids.</p>
<h3>Standard American and 2/1 systems</h3>
<p>Older generations of American bridge players overwhelmingly used some
variation of the <q>Standard American</q> system. In Standard American, for
example, a 1&hearts; opening bid shows at least 5 hearts, a 1NT response shows
6&ndash;10 HCP, and a 2&diams; response shows at least 4 diamonds with 10+ HCP.
Among younger players, <q>two over one</q> (2/1) systems are more popular. In
a 2/1 system, the 1&hearts; opening still shows at least 5 hearts, but now a
1NT response shows 6&ndash;12 HCP and is forcing, and a 2&diams; response shows
13+ HCP and is also forcing.</p>
<p>Although I'm a young man, I learned bidding from a book called
<em>Standard Bidding with SAYC</em>. I would recommend this book to others,
except that it teaches Standard American, rather than 2/1. So I wrote this page
for beginners to understand how to use a 2/1 system.</p>
<h3>The design of bidding systems</h3>
<p>All new players will have to ask themselves the question: why should I use
one bidding system rather than another? The answer is that the main purpose of
a bidding system is to help you and your partner reach a contract in which
you'll score as many points as possible. Each bid communicates information to
your partner and, if all other players pass, places the contract. You want to
communicate with your partner as efficiently as possible, but the only way to
do so is through your calls. Therefore, you and your partner should try to find
ways to assign meanings to your calls that cover the most common and useful
pieces of information that you would want to communicate during typical
auctions. If you have been playing a certain bidding system, and noticing that
partnerships that play other bidding systems have tended to reach better
contracts and score more points than you, it makes sense to have a discussion
with your partner about whether you should incorporate some conventions that
other partnerships use into your own system.</p>
<p>In the later sections, I'm going to describe the agreements
that I usually play with my bridge partners, but moreover, I will explain the
problems that each agreement is intended to solve, or, more broadly, why each
agreement is useful. I believe that if you understand the reasoning, the system
will make sense, and you won't need to memorize as much.</p>
<h3>Interpretation of bids</h3>
<p>Generally, the meaning of a bid depends on the context in which the bid was
made. For example, in the system we will be using, an <em>opening</em> bid
of 1&hearts; indicates that the opener has at least 12 total points and 5
hearts (more on this later). However, if one of the opponents were to open and
then your partner overcalled 1&hearts;, it may not mean that your partner has
12+ total points; they might have less.</p>
<p>In general, when your partner makes some bid, you should interpret it
according to the agreement that you and your partner have, and that agreement
will often provide that the meaning of a bid varies depending on context.
Similarly, when you are about to bid, make sure that you choose a bid that,
when considering the context, will be interpreted correctly by your partner; do
not use a bid that has your intended meaning in a different context, but which,
in the present context, is not accurate.</p>
<p>Sometimes your partner may make a bid and you may realize that, in the
context in which your partner's bid was made, the two of you don't have an
explicit agreement that assigns a meaning to that bid. Even still, that doesn't
mean that the bid has the same meaning there as it would in another context. To
interpret the bid, you would need to think about the principles behind the
design of bidding systems, and what information your partner might be trying to
communicate, based on likely objectives in the context. Of course, it is better
to have an agreement, to remove the ambiguity.</p>
