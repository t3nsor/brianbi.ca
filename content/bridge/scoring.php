<h2>Overview of duplicate bridge scoring</h2>
<p>The scoring rules of bridge are complicated, but there a few basic rules
that we should go over. It is not possible to understand bidding unless you
understand scoring. After all, the ultimate goal of a bidding system is to
help you score as many points as possible.</p>
<ul>
<li>The suits are worth different amounts of points. Each club or diamond level
is worth 20 points. Each heart or spade level is worth 30 points. Notrump is
worth 30 points per level plus an extra 10 points. For example, 3&hearts; is
worth 90 points (3 times 30) whereas 2NT is worth 70 points (3 times 30 plus
10). Because of this, your partnership will usually want to play in hearts or
spades instead of clubs or diamonds. Hearts and spades are called the
<strong>major suits</strong> whereas clubs and diamonds are called the
<strong>minor suits</strong>. Sometimes we may want to refer to a major suit
without specifying which one; in that case, the uppercase letter <q>M</q> is
used. Similarly, lowercase <q>m</q> means a minor suit. For example, if we say
your partner bids 1m in some hypothetical scenario, it means your partner bids
1&clubs; or 1&diams; and it was not important to specify which.</li>
<li>If you make overtricks (you win more tricks than the contract requires) then
they are scored at the same rate as regular tricks. So for example, bidding
2&spades; and winning 9 tricks is worth 60 points for making the contract plus
another 30 points for the extra spade level. Bidding 3&spades; and winning 9
tricks is also worth 90 points. But bidding 4&spades; and winning only 9 tricks
means the contract was defeated, and the opponents would get points instead of
your side.</li>
<li>If you make a contract with a base value of 100 points or more, you get a
special 300 point bonus. (If vulnerable, the bonus is 500 points instead of
300.) This is called a <strong>game level contract</strong>. A contract of
4&hearts; or 4&spades; has a base value of 120, so it is game level. A contract
of 5&clubs; or 5&diams; has a base value of 100, so it is game level. A
contract of 3NT has a base value of 100 (3 times 30 plus 10), so it is also
game level. You only get the game bonus if you actually <em>bid</em> high
enough. For example, bidding 3&spades; and winning 10 tricks does not get the
game bonus, whereas bidding 4&spades; and winning 10 tricks (just barely making
the contract) does get the game bonus. Of course, you get no game bonus if you
fail to make your contract.</li>
<li>Since making a game level contract is worth so much, <strong>an
important goal of the bidding system is figuring out between you and your
partner whether making a game level contract is possible.</strong> And if you
and your partner can make a game level contract, then <strong>another important
goal is figuring out how to select the best game level contract to
bid.</strong> Remember, you have five choices: 5&clubs;, 5&diams;, 4&hearts;,
4&spades;, 3NT.</li>
<li>Selection of the appropriate game level contract should be made
according to the following guidelines:<ul>
<li>Usually if you and your partner hold at least 25 points together, it is
possible to make a game level contract. Therefore it is important for the
bidding system to accurately communicate strength so you and your partner can
figure out whether you have 25 points between the two of you.</li>
<li>If you and your partner have a lot of hearts&mdash;generally, at least 8
between both of you&mdash;it's usually easier to make
a 4&hearts; contract than a 3NT contract. Likewise 4&spades; is usually easier
to make than 3NT if you have lots of spades. So if you and your partner have
decided to go to game, and you have enough of a major suit between you, you
will want to play in 4 of that major. The bidding system must be designed to
help you figure out not only whether you have 25 points, but also whether you
have enough hearts or spades.</li>
<li>If you and your partner have decided to go to game but you can't go to
4&hearts; or 4&spades; because you don't have enough of the suit, then usually
it is easier to make 3NT than 5&clubs; or 5&diams;. But there is a danger of
being in 3NT. If for example you have only a few small hearts and your partner
also has only a few small hearts, then the opponents can just <q>run
hearts</q>, that is, play all their hearts at the beginning and win a bunch of
tricks. Once they win 5 tricks, the contract is defeated since there are only
8 tricks left for your side to win, and you need 9 to make the contract. So
before going to 3NT, you should make sure you have <q>stoppers</q> in all four
suits, meaning that you have some card that can eventually win so your side can
get back in control.
(You do not need to be absolutely sure that you have all four suits stopped. The
most important thing is that if the auction indicates that the opponents have
length in a suit, then you should make sure you have <em>that</em> suit stopped
before you try to play in 3NT.)
</li>
<li>If you are deficient in hearts and spades, and have unbalanced hands so
that 3NT is dangerous, you must have either a lot of clubs together or a lot of
diamonds together. So in those cases, you can try to go to 5&clubs; or
5&diams;. Since this requires getting 11 out of the 13 tricks, it's not so
easy, so going to 5&clubs; or 5&diams; should be a last resort when you've
figured out that the other game level contracts wouldn't be successful.
Actually, sometimes when you only have 25 points together, you just won't be
able to make 5&clubs; or 5&diams; even if you have a lot of clubs or diamonds.
In those cases you might have to stop at the 4 level&mdash;you won't get the
game bonus, but at least you'll get some points. You would need to have
something like 29 points together in order to have an excellent chance of
making 5&clubs; or 5&diams;. With only 25, it's not so certain.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If you and your partner realize that you don't have 25 points together,
you should usually try to put the brakes on the bidding. There is no point in
going higher. For example, remember that 2&spades;+1 is worth the same as
3&spades;. (There is no bonus for bidding a higher contract, unless it is at
least game level.)
But there are situations where it is legitimate to bid 4&hearts; or 4&spades;
even when you and your partner don't have 25 points together. Usually this will
be a situation where you or your partner have a highly unbalanced hand. When a
hand is highly unbalanced, it can be stronger than the point system would
suggest. Knowing information about the opponents' hands can also affect how good
your hand seems, and can help your side play more accurately if you win the
contract. So, although bidding systems are designed to convey point strength
accurately, it is important to use your judgement to reach the best contract,
regardless of how many points you have.
</li>
<li>When you fail to make your contract, the opponents score 50 points per
undertrick. For example, bidding 4&hearts; but winning only 8 tricks means you
missed by two tricks, so the opponents score 100 points. However, when your
side is vulnerable, undertricks cost 100 points each rather than 50. If the
opponents have doubled your contract, the penalties are even higher.</li>
<li>When you bid and make a contract with a base value of less than 100
points&mdash;so not a game level contract&mdash;this is called a
<em>partscore</em> contract and you get a 50 point bonus for making it. So
for example bidding and making 2&clubs; is actually worth 90 points, not 40.
This gives you more of an incentive to try to make a contract rather than
defeating the opponents' contract. For example, if opponents have bid 1&spades;
and you think you can bring them down 1 trick, you would get 50 points from
doing that. But if instead you competed in the auction and bid up to 2&clubs;
and made that contract, you would get 90 points (not 40), which is better.</li>
<li>Even when you and your partner don't have enough for game, you will still
usually be able to score more tricks with a 8 card suit fit (8 cards of one
suit between the two of you) than you will in notrump. Therefore it is useful
for the bidding system to still help you try to find a 8 card <em>major</em> fit
even at partscore. For example, if you have enough points together so that you
could make a 1NT contract, but you also have an 8 card fit in spades, then you
will probably be able to make a 2&spades; contract, and choosing 2&spades;
instead of 1NT will score your side 110 points instead of 90, assuming you
make the contract.</li>
<li>A 2m contract scores 90 points when made, just like 1NT. If you and your
partner have no 8-card major fit, and you also don't have enough strength to
make 3NT or 5m, then you'll often end up in 1NT or 2m. If you have a 8-card
<em>minor</em> fit, then sometimes 2m is a <q>better</q> contract than 1NT
(though not always). If you don't have a 8-card minor fit, 1NT is almost always
a better contract than 2m. (By <q>better</q>, we mean likely to yield a higher
score. A contract that can be made is better than a contract that will go down,
but sometimes both contracts will make and one will score higher than the other
due to overtricks.) Even if 2m is a better contract than 1NT, the benefit of
playing in 2m is usually slight. Therefore, finding minor partscores is usually
not a priority. Staying in a relatively safe 1NT contract is usually better
than pushing the bidding too high to search for a minor suit fit.</li>
