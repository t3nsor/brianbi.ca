<h2>Supporting a major suit</h2>
<p>In <a href="/bridge/1resp">the previous section</a>, we went over how a
8-card major fit can be found.  For example, if your partner opens 1&spades;
and you have three spades, you know that you have at least 8 spades together.
However, your partner doesn't know that yet.  If you open 1&clubs; and your
partner responds 1&hearts;, and you realize that you also have 4 hearts, again,
you know that you have a 8-card fit in hearts, but your partner doesn't know
that yet. In order to make sure both of you are aware of your 8-card fit,
<strong>when you have a fit for a suit your partner bid, you should also bid
that suit.</strong> That's called <q>showing support</q>. Once you've shown
support, the two of you have reached a <q>suit agreement</q>. As a general
rule, once you've agreed on a major suit, you know for sure that you want to
try to play a contract in that suit.</p>
<h3>Showing support with a minimum hand</h3>
<p>As discussed in the previous section, when your partner was the opener, you
should only respond with at least 6 points. Note that once an 8-card fit is
found, you should reevaluate your hand with distribution points for
<em>shortness</em> rather than length. For example, if your partner has opened
1&spades; and you have this hand, you have 7 points and you should bid
2&spades;:
<?=ch('7543', 'AJ54', '3', '9764')?>
</p>
<p>If <strong>you</strong> were the opener and now you want to show support for
your partner's 4-card major suit, you don't need to have any extra strength.
For example, if you opened 1&clubs; with this hand, which contains 13 points
and is therefore a <q>minimum</q> opener:
<?=ch('A42', 'QT92', 'QJ9', 'A72')?>
and your partner responded 1&hearts;, showing 4 hearts, then you can bid
2&hearts; to show support for hearts.</p>
<p>When you show support by raising to the two level, the partnership has at
least 18 points together, but most likely a few more. Generally, having 20
points together is enough to make a two-level contract (8 tricks). That's
because you set the trump suit to be a suit that you and your partner have,
which gives you an advantage in trick-taking compared to the defenders (your
opponents). Even with exactly 18 points, you still have a chance of making the
contract.</p>
<p>As discussed previously, when opener finds out that their partner has 6+
points, and a major suit fit is established, opener can raise to the 4 level
if they themselves have at least 19 points, since the partnership then has a
total of 25+. This auction is a fairly typical one:
<span class="auctionContainer">
<?=auction(array('P', '1&spades;', 'P', '2&spades;',
                 'P', '4&spades;', 'P', 'P',
                 'P', '', '', ''))?>
</span>
assuming that you are sitting north, and your hand looks something like this:
<?=ch('AKJT8', 'K96', 'T9', 'AK9')?>
You have 18 HCP and 1 distribution point in diamonds, so you have 19 total
points. Once partner has responded 2&spades;, you know that you have 25+ points
together and a 8-card fit in spades, so you waste no time in going to game.</p>
<h3>Showing support with an invitational hand</h3>
<p>If your partner has opened and your hand is significantly better than 6
points, it's also important to communicate your higher strength. What happens,
for example, if your partner opened 1M with 15 points and you have 10 points?
If you simply bid 2M, then your partner will probably pass since for all they
know, you might only have 6. Then, game will be missed! How can you
communicate your better-than-minimum hand to your partner? Obviously, you will
have to bid something other than 2M.</p>
<p>Here is a general principle of bidding: if you have a bidding system
where you haven't assigned a meaning to a particular possible bid yet, then you
should consider assigning a meaning to it, otherwise you are simply foregoing
an opportunity to communicate information to your partner. In our case, so far
we have only covered one-level responses, a raise to the two-level, and a raise
to the four-level. So far we haven't assigned any meaning to a three-level bid.
Perhaps we should do that now.</p>
<p>The most natural solution is that you still bid your partner's suit to show
suit agreement, but since you have a better hand, you can get away with going
to 3M instead of 2M. Then your partner can decide whether or not to go to 4M.
In effect, your 3M bid <em>extends an invitation</em> to your partner to go to
game, which your partner can either accept or decline.
If your partner chooses not to go to 4M, the two of you will probably have
enough strength together to make the 3M contract. Generally, the 3M response is
used when you have 10 to 12 points. This is also called a
<strong>limit raise</strong> because of how it precisely limits the strength
of your hand.</p>
<p>Thus, if your partner opened 1&spades; and you have the following hand:
<?=ch('KT93', 'K63', 'KT2', 'J63')?>
then your response would be 3&spades;. With at least 15 points, your partner
would then go up to 4&spades;. With only 12&ndash;14, partner would pass, and
would play the 3&spades; contract. You'd have at least 22 total points and a
8-card spade fit, which is most likely good enough so that the 3&spades;
contract is makeable.</p>
<p>Likewise, with the following hand, where you are sitting south:
<?=ch('KT93', 'K632', 'KT', 'J63')?>
a possible bidding sequence begins:
<span class="auctionContainer">
<?=auction(array('P', '1&clubs;', 'P', '1&hearts;',
                 'P', '1&spades;', 'P', '3&spades;'))?>
</span>
Here, you jump raise to 3&spades; once the 8-card spade fit is found.</p>
<p>The opener can also be the one to extend an invitation. If for example you
have the following hand and are sitting north:
<?=ch('AJ8', 'AJ54', 'KQ', 'J63')?>
then the auction might start like this:
<span class="auctionContainer">
<?=auction(array('P', '1&clubs;', 'P', '1&hearts;',
                 'P', '3&hearts;', '', ''))?>
</span>
Here, you make the jump raise to 3&hearts; because you have 17 points, which is
significantly above typical opening strength. Generally, an invitational jump
raise is made by the opener with 16 to 18 points. Responder can then raise to
4&hearts; if they have at least 9 points.</p>
<p>Of course, there is still a gap here. If you made an
invitational jump raise with 17 points and your partner had 8 points, they
would only know that you have 16 to 18 points, so they would only know that you
have 24 points together&mdash;not quite enough to go to game. Well, no system
is perfect. All you can do is design a system that will help you get to game
most of the time. Some cases will fall through the cracks.</p>
<p>To recap, the general rule here is to make an invitational bid to
communicate more than minimum strength once a suit fit has been found. That
holds for both the opener and responder. For opener, invitational strength is
16 to 18 points. For responder, it's 10 to 12 points. Whether you're opener or
responder, you should also be prepared to receive an invitation from your
partner. When that happens, determine whether or not you want to go to game,
based on your hand's point count and the point count your partner is
communicating.</p>
<h3>Showing support with a game-forcing hand</h3>
<p>If you had the following hand, you would open 1&clubs;:
<?=ch('AKJT', 'K96', 'T9', 'AK98')?>
If your partner responds 1&spades;, there's no sense beating around the bush;
with 19 total points, you already know you have enough for game, so you can
directly bid 4&spades;. This is a <em>double jump raise</em>, since two levels
are being skipped.</p>
<p>You can also double jump raise as responder with at least 13 points, since
if you have 13 and your partner opened (showing 12+) then you know you have
25+. For example, with the following hand, where you are sitting south:
<?=ch('KT93', 'K632', 'KT', 'A63')?>
a possible bidding sequence is:
<span class="auctionContainer">
<?=auction(array('P', '1&clubs;', 'P', '1&hearts;',
                 'P', '1&spades;', 'P', '4&spades;'))?>
</span>
