<h2>How does the unification of electricity and magnetism work when comparing charge and spin?</h2>
<div id="question_details">On one level, I've learned that a relativistic transformed E-field or B field is the other (I think). So I think of E fields as originating from charges or changing magnetic fields, and B fields as originating from moving charges, changing E fields, or quantum spins. How are the spins and charges related?</div>

<div id="answer_content">I interpret the question as follows: <i>if a spinning charged particle generates magnetic fields, then what is responsible for generating the <strong>electric</strong> field that you see when we boost into a different reference frame? Does the spin turn into a charge somehow?</i><br><br>Well, now you are trying to combine classical and quantum thinking, because in classical electrodynamics we think in terms of charges and currents which generate E and B fields, but in <i>quantum</i> electrodynamics the E and B fields are an afterthought, the "true" field is more closely related to the four-potential, and instead of charges and currents we deal in wave functions.<br><br>But what you might not realize is that there <i>is</i> a current density associated with the electron, even though everyone always tells you that you can't think of the electron as a spinning ball of charge! This current density is given by the expression<br><br>\(j^\mu = -e\overline{\psi}\gamma^\mu\psi\)<br><br>where \(e\) is the absolute value of the charge of the electron, and \(\psi\) is the Dirac spinor describing the electron's wavefunction; a solution to the Dirac equation.<br><br>It can be shown that even when the electron is at rest (in a given reference frame), the current density can be nonzero, and circulates around the electron's spin axis. The four-current \(j^\mu\) on the left hand side of the previously given equation is a Lorentz four-vector, so upon transformation to another frame it transforms correctly and results in an <i>electric</i> dipole moment for the electron which is not present at rest! So the spinning electron does have charge and current densities which are related in a natural way just like the charge and current densities of classical systems, and can in fact be seen to give rise to the electron's magnetic dipole moment&mdash;even though the picture of the electron as a spinning ball of charge is inapplicable.<br><br>I don't have the mathematical sophistication to explain the details but you can find them in this paper: <a href=http://www.physics.mcmaster.ca/phys3mm3/notes/whatisspin.pdf>What is spin?</a></div>
