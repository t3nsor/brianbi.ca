<h2>What would the acceleration due to gravity be on the surface of a black hole?</h2>
<div id="question_details">If the acceleration due to gravity is so high that even light cannot escape it, what will be the speed/consequences of a body accelerated by it?</div>

<div id="answer_content">It depends on your coordinate system! In curved space-time, there is no canonical choice of coordinate system, unlike in flat space, where you will basically always want to choose Minkowski coordinates, in which the speed of light is constant everywhere and in all directions.<br><br>Let's assume the black hole is uncharged and nonrotating. If you are far away from the black hole, then the natural choice of coordinate system is Schwarzschild coordinates. In Schwarzschild coordinates, the metric is approximately Minkowski far away from the black hole, which makes sense since you are far away.<br><br>The funny thing is that in Schwarzschild coordinates, it takes an infinite amount of coordinate time for an object to fall into a black hole. That is, as it approaches the event horizon, it actually <i>slows down</i>, and never quite falls in. So in Schwarzschild coordinates, the answer is: zero! The acceleration is zero right at the event horizon.<br><br>There is also a concept of <i>proper acceleration</i>, which is coordinate system invariant, but the proper acceleration is <i>also</i> zero for a particle travelling along a geodesic (that is, under the influence of gravitational forces alone)! The proper acceleration is basically the coordinate-invariant measure of the <i>non-gravitational</i> acceleration experienced by an object.<br><br>Now, I know you don't want to hear that a particle falling into a black hole experiences no acceleration, so what exactly is the answer you want to hear? The figure you're probably interested in is <i>the proper acceleration required to stop the particle from falling in,</i> measured with respect
to Schwarzschild coordinates. This may seem confusing, since I just said that in Schwarzschild coordinates the particle slows down as it approaches the horizon anyway. Well, the difference is, if you apply enough proper acceleration, the particle will actually stop before it reaches the horizon. But the closer the particle is to the horizon already, the more proper acceleration you need; and the closer to the horizon you apply it, the less effect it seems to have in Schwarzschild coordinates.<br><br>Anyway, the formula is given here: <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proper_acceleration#Surface_dwellers_on_a_planet>Proper acceleration#Surface_dwel<wbr></wbr>lers_on_a_planet</a><br><br>The acceleration is \(\sqrt{\frac{r}{r-r_s}} \frac{GM}{r^2}\), where \(M\) is the black hole mass and \(r_s\) is the Schwarzschild radius. As you might expect, this diverges to infinity as \(r \to r_s\), that is, as you approach the event horizon.</div>
