<h2>What determines the frequency of gravitational waves?</h2>
</div>
<div id="answer_content">The frequency of gravitational waves, like the frequency of electromagnetic waves, is determined by the frequency of the oscillations in the source.<br><br>For example, with the appropriate choice of gauge, the gravitational radiation far from a non-relativistic source localized near the origin is described to leading order by the well-known <b>quadrupole formula:</b>\[h_{ij}(\mathbf{x}, t) \approx \frac{2G}{c^4 r} \ddot{Q}_{ij}(t_r)\] where \(Q\) is the energy density quadrupole moment, and \(t_r\) is the retarded time, as in electrodynamics. The quantity \(h_{ij}\) is a perturbation to the background flat  metric \(\eta_{ij}\) and represents the field of gravitational radiation. So it is easy to see that if the source oscillates with a frequency \(f\) in such a way that its quadrupole moment has nonzero second derivative, then it will emit gravitational radiation with frequency \(f\).<br><br>(<i>Note</i>: Compare this with the formula from electrodynamics, \(\mathbf{A} \approx \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi r} \dot{\mathbf{p}}(t_r)\).)</div>
