<h2>Section 7.4. The Class Equation of the Icosahedral Group</h2>
<p><span class="problem">Exercise 7.4.1</span> In Theorem 7.4.4 it was proved
that the image of the action of \(I\) on the set of five cubes is \(A_5\).
The stabilizer of a single cube is therefore the subgroup of \(A_5\) that
leaves one element, say, index 1, fixed. If \(\sigma \in A_5\) satisfies
\(\sigma(1) = 1\) then the restriction \(\sigma|_{\{2, 3, 4, 5\}}\) must also
be even, and each such even permutation can be uniquely extended to an even
permutation on the entire set that fixes 1. Therefore the desired subgroup is
simply \(A_4\).</p>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 7.4.2</span> Yes. In fact, we will prove the
more general statement that for all \(n \geq 5\), \(A_n\) is the only proper
normal subgroup of \(S_n\). Let \(N\) be a normal subgroup of \(S_n\). Then the
set \(N'\) consisting only of the even permutations in \(N\) would be a
subgroup of \(N\). It would also be normal since the conjugate of an even
permutation is also another even permutation. Therefore \(N'\) would be a
normal subgroup of \(S_n\) that is contained within the \(A_n\) subgroup.
Therefore \(N'\) would be a normal subgroup of \(A_n\).  Since \(A_n\) is
simple, either \(N'\) is trivial or \(N' = A_n\).</p>

<p>If \(N'\) is trivial, then either \(N\) is trivial or else \(N\) consists
only of the identity and odd permutations. Let \(\sigma\) be an odd
permutation in \(N\). Clearly \(\sigma^2\) must be the identity. If there is
any other odd permutation in \(N\), then the product of these two odd
permutations would be an even permutation that isn't the identity, which is a
contradiction. So \(N = \{1, \sigma\}\). It's easy to see that such \(N\) could
not be normal.</p>

<p>If \(N'\) is \(A_n\), then either \(N = A_n\) or else \(N\) contains
some odd permutation \(\sigma\), the set \(\sigma A_n\) would consist of the
\(n!/2\) distinct odd permutations of \(S_n\), and therefore \(N\) would be
all of \(S_n\).</p>

<p>We conclude that the only proper normal subgroup of \(S_n\) is \(A_n\).</p>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 7.4.3</span> It was determined in the text
that the elements of \(I\) of order 2 belong to a conjugacy class of size 15
and each represents a 180 degree rotation around the axis joining two opposite
edges. Let \(g\) be such an element associated to edge \(e\). The centralizer
\(Z(g)\) must have order 4 and since \(I\) contains no elements of order 4,
\(Z(g)\) can only contain elements of order 2, implying that \(Z(g) \cong
V_4\). To actually describe the elements of this \(V_4\) subgroup of \(I\),
observe that there are
four edges perpendicular to \(e\), which occur in two pairs of opposite
edges that are also perpendicular to each other. They therefore have two
associated rotations \(h, i\) and the three rotations \(g, h, i\) are 180
degree rotations around mutually perpendicular axes. Therefore \(g\) commutes
with \(h\) and \(i\) and the elements \(\{1, g, h, i\}\) constitute the
centralizer of \(e\). This group is not the cyclic group of order 4 so it can
only be the Klein four-group.</p>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 7.4.4</span></p>
<ol class="subproblems">
<li>Using Corollary 5.1.28(b) as in the similar calculation for the icosahedral
group done in the text, if \(V\) is a vertex of the tetrahedron then a rotation
by \(2\pi/3\) counterclockwise around the axis joining a vertex to the centroid
is conjugate to each other such rotation. However in order to get the rotation
by \(2\pi/3\) clockwise, which is a rotation by \(2\pi/3\) counterclockwise
where the pole \(P\) is above the opposite face, we would have to conjugate by
a rotation that maps \(V\) to \(P\), which is not therefore in \(T\). Therefore
the four 120-degree clockwise rotations fall into a different conjugacy class
from the four 120-degree counterclockwise rotations. The three 180 degree
rotations are also seen to form a single conjugacy class of size 3. So the
class equation is \(12 = 1 + 3 + 4 + 4\).</li>
<li>Any subgroup of \(T\) with 6 elements would have to be normal, but 6 is not
the sum of any set of terms in the class equation including 1. So there is no
subgroup of order 6. There is only one subgroup of order 4: such a subgroup
cannot contain any of the elements of order 3, so it must consist of the
identity and the three 180-degree rotations. Since this is the only subgroup of
order 4 in \(T\), it is normal.</li>
</ol>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 7.4.5</span></p>
<ol class="subproblems">
<li>Using Corollary 5.1.28(b) as in the similar calculation for the icosahedral
group done in the text, all six 90-degree rotations form a single conjugacy
class, as do the eight 120-degree rotations. The six 180-degree rotations that
have an axis passing through the midpoints of opposite edges of a cube are
likewise conjugate to each other and the three 180-degree rotations that have
an axis passing through the centres of opposite faces are conjugate to each
other. These last
two groups are separate conjugacy classes because by Corollary 5.1.28(b), if
conjugation by a rotation \(B\) mapped a rotation with an edge pole to a
rotation with a face pole, then \(B\) itself would have to map the edge pole
to the face pole, so \(B \notin O\). We conclude that the class equation is
\(24 = 1 + 3 + 6 + 6 + 8\).</li>
<li>There are two sets of terms in the class equation including the 1 that
sum to a proper divisor of 24: namely, \(1 + 3\) and \(1 + 3 + 8\). From the
analysis in part (a) we know that the conjugacy class of order 3 consists of
the three rotations \(\rho_{f, \pi}\) for \(f\) a face and the conjugacy
class of order 8 consists of the rotations \(\rho_{v, 2\pi/3}\) for \(v\) a
vertex. If these sets \(G_4\) and \(G_{12}\) are subgroups of
\(O\), then they are normal. It is clear enough that \(G_4\) is a group
isomorphic to \(V_4\); it's just the group consisting of the identity and
three 180 degree rotations around mutually perpendicular axes. Meanwhile, the
quickest way to characterize \(G_{12}\) is to observe that
each 120-degree rotation induces a
3-cycle on the other three body diagonals while each 180-degree rotation in
\(G_{12}\) exchanges two pairs of body diagonals, so each element of \(G_{12}\)
induces an even permutation of the four body diagonals. This implies that
\(G_{12}\) is isomorphic to the \(A_4\) subgroup of \(O\) when regarded as
\(S_4\). See Exercise 7.4.6(a).</li>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 7.4.6</span></p>
<ol class="subproblems">
<li>In <a href="/artin/6.9">Exercise 6.9.4</a> we showed that \(T \cong A_4\).
The proof that \(O \cong S_4\) is even easier. Let \(S\) be the
set consisting of the four body diagonals of a cube. From considering the
different kinds of rotations in \(O\), it is clear that the only element of
\(O\) that fixes all four body diagonals is the identity element. That is, the
action \(\varphi : O \to \operatorname{Perm}(S)\) is faithful. But these two
groups both have order 24, so \(O \cong S_4\).</li>
<li>The 12 elements of \(O\) that belong to the \(A_4\) subgroup are also
rotational symmetries of the inscribed tetrahedra; that is, the tetrahedral
group arises as the \(A_4\) subgroup of the octahedral group. The other 12
elements of \(O\) exchange the two tetrahedra.</li>
</ol>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 7.4.7</span> Since \(|G| &gt;
|\operatorname{Perm}(S)|\) where \(S\) is the set that \(G\) acts on, the
permutation representation \(\varphi : G \to \operatorname{Perm}(S)\) is not
faithful. The kernel of \(\varphi\) is therefore not trivial. It also isn't
the entire group \(G\) since we are told that \(G\) acts nontrivially on \(S\).
Therefore \(\ker \varphi\) is a proper normal subgroup of \(G\).</p>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 7.4.8</span></p>
<ol class="subproblems">
<li>The centre is a subgroup of the centralizer, so it can only have order 1,
2, or 4.</li>
<li>By the Lemma in the <a href="/artin/7.2">solutions to Section 7.2</a>, the
order of the centre is \(|G|/(4k)\) for some integer \(k &gt; 1\).
Additionally, we can say that \(y \notin Z\).</li>
</ol>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 7.4.9</span> We know \(x \in Z(x)\). The
order of \(x\) must be \(p\), \(q\), or \(pq\). If it is \(pq\) then \(Z(x)\)
is just \(C_{pq}\). Otherwise, without loss of generality, say the order of
\(x\) is \(p\). Let \(H = \langle x \rangle\) and take \(y \in Z(x) \setminus
H\). Let \(K = \langle y \rangle\). Note that \(H\) is a normal subgroup of
\(Z(x)\). By Proposition 2.11.4, \(HK\) is a subgroup of \(Z(x)\) which
contains \(H\) as a proper subgroup. By Lagrange's theorem, \(HK\) must be
all of \(Z(x)\). But then \(Z(x)\) is generated by \(x\) and \(y\), which
commute with each other since \(y \in Z(x)\); therefore \(Z(x)\) is
abelian.</p>
