<h2>Section 16.7. The Main Theorem</h2>
<p><span class="problem">Exercise 16.7.1</span> We assume that
\(\sqrt{b} \notin F(\sqrt{a})\) and \(\sqrt{a} \notin F(\sqrt{b})\). This
implies that \([F(\sqrt{a}, \sqrt{b}) : F] = 4\). Any intermediate fields must
therefore be quadratic extensions of \(F\). Clearly, \(F(\sqrt{a})\),
\(F(\sqrt{b})\), and \(F(\sqrt{ab})\) are three such intermediate fields. If
there is any other intermediate field besides these three, it must be generated
by an element of the form
\(\zeta = p\sqrt{a} + q\sqrt{b} + r\sqrt{ab}\), where \(p, q, r \in F\). We
have that \(\zeta^2 = (p^2 a + q^2 b + r^2 ab) + 2qrb\sqrt{a} + 2pra\sqrt{b}
+ 2pq\sqrt{ab}\). In order for \(\zeta\) to have degree 2, we need
\([p : q : r] = [2qrb : 2pra : 2pq]\). If any of \(p, q, r\) vanish, it is easy
to see that this condition forces at least one other to vanish, so one of the
three intermediate fields previously described is obtained. Otherwise, write
\(p^2ra = q^2rb\), implying \(p\sqrt{a} = \pm q\sqrt{b}\). If \(p, q \ne 0\),
this implies that \(\sqrt{a} \in F(\sqrt{b})\), contradiction. So there are no
other intermediate fields.</p>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 16.7.4</span> We argued in
<a href="/artin/16.6">Exercise 16.6.2</a> that \(\Gal(\Q(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3},
\sqrt{5})/\Q) \cong C_3^2\). The intermediate fields correspond to the
subgroups of \(C_3^2\). Besides the obvious trivial subgroup and \(C_3^2\)
itself, which, by the fundamental theorem, correspond to \(\Q(\sqrt{2},
\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{5})\) and \(\Q\), respectively, there should be 7 intermediate
fields \(L\) with \([L : F] = 4\), corresponding to the 7 subgroups of
\(C_2^3\) of index 4 (order 2), each generated by one of its nontrivial
elements. These correspond to the 7 intermediate fields of degree 4 over
\(\Q\), namely \(\Q(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3})\), \(\Q(\sqrt{2},
\sqrt{5})\), \(\Q(\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{5})\), \(\Q(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{15})\),
\(\Q(\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{10})\), \(\Q(\sqrt{5}, \sqrt{6})\), and
\(\Q(\sqrt{6}, \sqrt{10})\). The subgroups of \(C_2^3\) of index 2 (order 4)
must all be isomorphic to \(V_4\), and correspond to 2-dimensional subspaces
of \(C_2^3\) viewed as a vector space over \(\mathbb{F}_2\), so there are
7 such subgroups, namely \(\{\{(x, y, z) \mid x, y, z \in \mathbb{F}_2,
px + qy + rz = 0\} \mid (p, q, r) \in \mathbb{F}_2^3 \setminus \{0\}\}\). These
correspond to the 7 intermediate fields of degree 2 over \(\Q\), namely
\(\Q(\sqrt{2})\), \(\Q(\sqrt{3})\), \(\Q(\sqrt{5})\), \(\Q(\sqrt{6})\), 
\(\Q(\sqrt{10})\), \(\Q(\sqrt{15})\), \(\Q(\sqrt{30})\).</p>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 16.7.5</span> Let \(F\) denote the splitting
field of \(f\), and let \(K\) denote the splitting field of \((x^3 - 1)f(x)\).
Let \(\alpha, \beta, \gamma\) denote the roots of \(f\) in \(F\), and let
\(\omega\) denote a complex cube root of unity. It is known that
\([F : \Q] = |S_3| = 6\). The possibilities are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Case 1:</em> \(\omega \in F\). Then \(K = F\), and
\(\Gal(K/\Q) = \Gal(F/\Q) = S_3\).</p></li>
<li><p><em>Case 2:</em> \(\omega \notin F\). Then \(K = F(\omega)\) and
\([K : F] = 2\) since \(\omega\) has degree 2 over \(\Q\). Consequently
\([K : \Q] = 12\), and \(\Gal(K/\Q)\) is one of the five groups of order 12
determined in section 7.8. Since \(F\) is an intermediate field and
\(F/\Q\) is a Galois extension, \(\Gal(K/\Q)\) possesses a normal subgroup
isomorphic to \(S_3\), although since such a subgroup would be of index 2, it
is automatically normal anyway. In any case, this immediately rules out the
abelian groups \(C_{12}\) and \(C_2 \times C_6\). It is well-known that
\(A_4\) also doesn't have a subgroup isomorphic to \(S_3\). Finally,
\(\operatorname{Dic}_3\) only has one element of order 2, so it can't contain
\(S_3\), which has three elements of order 2, as a subgroup. Therefore
\(\Gal(K/\Q)\) can only be \(D_6\).</p></li>
</ul>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 16.7.6</span> Since \(S_3\) has subgroups of
index 3, there is an intermediate field \(L\) with degree 3 over \(F\). Since
3 is prime, it follows that \(L = F(\alpha)\) where \(\alpha\) is any element
of \(L\setminus F\). The minimal polynomial of \(\alpha\) over \(F\) is
therefore cubic; call it \(f\). As the subgroups of \(S_3\) of index 3 are not
normal, \(L/F\) is not a Galois extension; therefore, \(f\) does not split
completely in \(L\). But since \(K\) is a splitting field over \(F\) and
\(f\) a root in \(K\), it follows that \(f\) splits completely in \(K\). The
field generated over \(F\) by the roots of \(f\) is strictly larger than
\(L\), but since \([K : L] = 2\), this field can only be \(K\). Therefore
\(K\) is the splitting field of the irreducible cubic \(f\).</p>

<ol class="subproblems">
<li><p>Since \(\Q \subseteq \Q(i + \sqrt{2}) \subseteq \Q(i, \sqrt{2})\), and
\([\Q(i, \sqrt{2}) : \Q] = 4\), the degree of \(\Q(i + \sqrt{2})\) over \(\Q\)
can only be 2 or 4. Our argument in the solution to Exercise 16.7.1 implies
that \(\sqrt{-1} + \sqrt{2}\) can't have degree 2 over \(\Q\), so it must have
degree 4. The minimal polynomial is therefore \((x - i - \sqrt{2})
(x - i + \sqrt{2})(x + i - \sqrt{2})(x + i + \sqrt{2}) =
x^4 - 2x^2 + 9\).</p></li>
<li><p>\([\Q(i, \sqrt{2}) : \Q] = 4\) and clearly the given set spans

<ol class="subproblems">
<li><p>The polynomial \(x^4 - 2\) is irreducible over \(\Q\) by the Eisenstein
criterion.</p></li>
<li><p>Obviously it factors as \((x^2 - \sqrt{2})(x^2 + \sqrt{2})\). Since
\(\Q(\sqrt{2})\) doesn't contain square roots of \(\pm\sqrt{2}\), these factors

<li><p>The factorization into irreducibles over \(\Q(i, \sqrt{2})\) is
\((x^2 - \sqrt{2})(x^2 + \sqrt{2})\) for the same reasons as in (b).</p></li>
<li><p>Over \(\Q(\sqrt[4]{2})\) we can evidently take the factorization further

The third factor remains irreducible since \(-\sqrt{2}\) has no square roots
in any subfield of the reals.</p></li>
<li><p>Over \(\Q(\sqrt[4]{2}, i)\) the polynomial \(x^4 - 2\) splits

</ol>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 16.7.9</span> By construction \(\Q(\zeta)\)
can't be larger than the splitting field, and \(x^5 - 1\) does split completely
in \(\Q(\zeta)\) as \(\prod_{i=0}^4 (x - \zeta^i)\). Therefore \(\Q(\zeta)\) is
the splitting field for \(x^5 - 1\) over \(\Q\). The cyclotomic polynomial
\((x^5 - 1)/(x - 1) = x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1\) is irreducible over \(\Q\), so
\([K : \Q] = 4\). Since \(K\) is a splitting field over \(\Q\), Theorem
16.6.4 implies that \(K/\Q\) is a Galois extension. Lemma 16.6.3 implies that
\(\Gal(K/\Q)\) contains an automorphism \(\sigma\) that sends \(\zeta\) to
\(\zeta^2\). Evidently \(\sigma^2(\zeta) = \zeta^4 \ne \zeta\), so
\(\Gal(K/\Q)\) is not the group \(V_4\), but must be \(C_4\).</p>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 16.7.10</span> The fixed field \(K^H\) is, by
definition, left invariant by \(H\), so \(H\) is a subgroup of the stabilizer
of every element of \(K^H\). By Theorem 15.8.1, the extension \(K^H/F\) has a
primitive element \(\beta\). Any \(F\)-automorphism of \(K\) fixing \(\beta\)
would fix \(F(\beta) = K^H\), so \(\beta\) cannot be left invariant by any
\(F\)-automorphism not in \(H\); that is, the stabilizer of \(\beta\) is
precisely \(H\).</p>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 16.7.11</span></p>
<ol class="subproblems">
<li><p>Since \(\Q \subseteq \Q(\gamma) \subseteq L\), and \([L : \Q] = 6\), the
degree of \(\gamma\) over \(\Q\) can only be 2, 3, or 6. Now \(\gamma^2 =
3 + \sqrt[3]{4} + 2\sqrt[3]{2}\sqrt{3}\) and \(\gamma^3 =
2 + 3\sqrt[3]{4}\sqrt{3} + 9\sqrt[3]{2} + 3\sqrt{3}\), so if any \(\Q\)-linear
combination involving \(1, \gamma, \gamma^2, \gamma^3\) vanishes, it must have
zero coefficient for \(\gamma^3\), which uniquely contains a
\(\sqrt[3]{4}\sqrt{3}\) factor, and \(\gamma^2\), which uniquely contains a
\(\sqrt[3]{4}\) factor. Evidently this implies that the other two coefficients
must be zero as well. So the degree of \(\gamma\) over \(\Q\) exceeds 3; it
must be 6. Thus \(\gamma\) is a primitive element for the extension
\(\Q(\alpha, \beta) / \Q\). By inspection, a polynomial with \(\gamma\) as a
root is
\begin{equation*}
f(x) = \prod_{j=0}^2 \prod_{k=0}^1 (x - e^{2\pi i j/3}\alpha -
(-1)^k \beta) = x^6 - 9x^4 - 4x^3 + 27x^2 - 36x - 23
\end{equation*}
Since this has degree 6 and rational coefficients, it is the minimal polynomial
sought.</p></li>
<li><p>\(K\) evidently contains \(L\), but \(K\) also contains the complex
cube roots of 2, so \(K\) is strictly larger than \(L\); it contains the
quadratic factor \(x^2 + \alpha x + \alpha^2\) which remains irreducible over
\(L\). So \([K : L] = 2\), and \([K : \Q] = 12\). As in Exercise 16.7.5, we
use the fact that there are only five possible isomorphism groups for
\(\Gal(K/\Q)\). Since there is an intermediate field \(\Q(\beta)\) of degree 2
over \(\Q\), it follows that \(\Gal(K/\Q)\) contains a subgroup of index 2,
which rules out \(A_4\). Furthermore, the intermediate field \(L\) corresponds
to a subgroup of index 6 and order 2. But \(L\) isn't a splitting field over
\(\Q\), since the irreducible polynomial \(f\) has the root \(\gamma \in L\)
but doesn't split completely in \(L\). So \(L/\Q\) isn't a Galois extension and
the subgroup corresponding to \(L\) isn't normal in \(\Gal(K/\Q)\). This
rules out the two abelian groups \(C_3 \times C_4\) and \(C_2 \times C_2 \times
C_3\), as well as \(\operatorname{Dic}_3\), which has only one subgroup of
order 2. Therefore \(\Gal(K/\Q) \cong D_6\) is the only possibility.</p></li>
