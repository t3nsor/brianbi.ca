<h2>Section 7.1. Cayley's Theorem</h2>
<p><span class="problem">Exercise 7.1.1</span> Yes. Clearly \(1 * x = x\) for
each \(x \in G\). Also \((g_1 g_2) * x = x(g_1 g_2)^{-1} = xg_2^{-1} g_1^{-1}
= (g_2 * x) g_1^{-1} = g_1 * (g_2 * x)\) for all \(g_1, g_2 \in G\). So the
axioms for \(*\) to be a group action are satisfied.</p>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 7.1.2</span> The orbit to which \(g \in G\)
belongs is the set \(Hg\), which is just a right coset of \(H\) in \(G\).
Therefore, the orbits of \(G\) under the action of left-multiplication by
\(H\) are precisely the right cosets.</p>
