<h2>Section 6.11. Permutation Representations</h2>
<p><span class="problem">Exercise 6.11.1</span> An action of \(S_3\) on a set
of four elements is a homomorphism \(\varphi : S_3 \to S_4\). The kernel of
this homomorphism is a normal subgroup of \(S_3\). There are three cases:</p>
<ol>
<li>\(\ker\varphi = S_3\). The action \(\varphi\) is therefore trivial.</li>
<li>\(\ker\varphi = A_3\). The image of \(\varphi\) has order 2, so it consists
of the identity plus some element of \(S_4\) that has order 2, of which there
are 9 in total (6 transpositions and 3 elements consisting of the product of a
pair of disjoint transpositions). The even
permutations in \(S_3\) therefore act trivially on the set, whereas the odd
permutations all permute the set in the same way, acting as the other element
of the image. There are therefore 9 such actions.</li>
<li>\(\ker\varphi\) is trivial. Then \(\varphi(x)\) must have order 3 in
\(S_4\); call it \(x'\). Likewise \(y' = \varphi(y)\) must have order 2, and
we must have \(y'x' = x'^2 y'\) in order for \(\varphi\) to be a valid
homomorphism. \(x'\) can only be a 3-cycle; without loss of generality, say
\(x' = (1\ 2\ 3)\). We know there is one valid choice \(y' = (1\ 2)\) and if
\(y'\) transposes two of the three elements 1, 2, 3 then we can always relabel
1, 2, 3 so that \(y' = (1\ 2)\). Now suppose
\(y'\) is a transposition involving the index 4; without loss of generality,
say \(y = (1\ 4)\) (we can simply relabel 1, 2, 3 to make this true). Then
\(y'x' = (1\ 2\ 3\ 4)\) and \(x'^2y' = (1\ 4\ 3\ 2)\), so this choice of \(y'\)
is not valid. Or suppose \(y'\) is a product of two transpositions; one of
these must involve two of the three elements 1, 2, 3, so again we can simply
relabel 1, 2, 3 so that \(y' = (1\ 2)(3\ 4)\). Then \(y'x' = (2\ 4\ 3)\) and
\(x'^2y' = (2\ 3\ 4)\), so again this choice of \(y'\) is not valid. Therefore
for any faithful action of \(S_3\) on a set of four elements there is some way
of labelling the elements so that \(x\) acts as \((1\ 2\ 3)\) and \(y\) as
\((1\ 2)\), \(S_3\) fixes one of the elements of the set and \(\sigma \in S_3\)
acts on the other three elements by permuting them according to
\(\sigma\).</li>
</ol>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 6.11.2</span> Suppose \(T\) acts on the set
of two elements nontrivially. Then the action is a surjective homomorphism
\(\varphi : T \to S_2\).  But we argued in <a href="/artin/6.9">Exercise
6.9.4</a> that \(T\) is
isomorphic to \(A_4\). We can now apply a similar argument to that used in
<a href="/artin/6.7">Exercise 6.7.11</a>: the image of a 3-cycle under
\(\varphi\) must be the identity, but the 3-cycles generate \(A_4\), so
\(\varphi\) is trivial, contradicting the assumption that \(\varphi\) is
surjective. Therefore the only possible action of \(T\) on a set of 2 elements
is trivial.</p>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 6.11.3</span> Let \(\varphi : G \to
\operatorname{Perm}(S)\) be the action of \(G\) on \(S\). Then, \(H\) is the
subset of \(G\) consisting of elements mapped to the identity permutation;
that is, \(H\) is the kernel of \(\varphi\). Therefore \(H\) is a normal
subgroup of \(G\).</p>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 6.11.4</span> \(D_4\) consists of the
identity, three rotations, and four reflections. The three rotations each have
no fixed points, each reflection across a diagonal has two fixed points, and
the other two reflections, across lines parallel to two sides of the square,
have no fixed point. That is, only the identity of \(D_4\) acts as the identity
on the set of four vertices; this action is faithful. On the other hand,
\(D_4\) does not act faithfully on the diagonals; for example, the 180 degree
rotation fixes both diagonals.</p>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 6.11.5</span> Denote the two orbits by
\(\{a, b, c\}, \{d, e\}\). The image of the action \(\varphi : G \to
\operatorname{Perm}(S)\) therefore consists only of those permutations that
leave these two subsets invariant, that is, \(\im \varphi \subseteq
S_3 \times S_2\). Thus the possible faithful actions are exactly the
injective homomorphisms \(\varphi : G \to S_3 \times S_2\). Such an
injective homomorphism exists if and only if \(G\) is isomorphic to a
subgroup of \(S_3 \times S_2\) (which will be its image under \(\varphi\)).
We will identify \(G\) with this subgroup from now on. We can break down the
possibilities into the following cases:</p>
<ol>
<li>\(G\) is a subgroup of the subgroup \(S_3 \times \{1\}\). The latter is
isomorphic to \(S_3\) itself, so \(G\) falls into one of the four isomorphism
classes of subgroups of \(S_3\), namely the trivial group, \(C_2\), \(C_3\),
or \(S_3\).</li>
<li>\(G\) contains the element \((1, -1)\) where \(-1\) denotes the
non-identity element of \(S_2\). If \(G_1 = \{g_1 \mid (g_1, g_2) \in G\}\),
then \(G_1\) is a subgroup and for each \(g_1 \in G_1\), both \((g_1, 1)\) and
\((g_1, -1)\) are in \(G\). \(G\) is then the direct product of some subgroup
of \(S_3\) with \(S_2\), that is, \(S_3 \times S_2\), \(C_3 \times S_2\),
\(C_2 \times S_2\), or just \(S_2\). Note that \(C_3 \times S_2\) is just
\(C_6\), \(C_2 \times S_2\) is the Klein four-group \(V\), and \(S_2\) is
just \(C_2\).</li>
<li>\(G\) doesn't contain the element \((1, -1)\) and there is only one
element \(\sigma \in S_3\) such that \((\sigma, -1) \in G\). Then there can't
be any \(\tau \in S_3 \setminus \{1\}\) such that \((\tau, 1) \in G\), because
the product would be \((\sigma', -1)\) where \(\sigma' \neq \sigma\). So
\(G = \{(1, 1), (\sigma, -1)\}\) and is just isomorphic to \(C_2\).</li>
<li>\(G\) doesn't contain the element \((1, -1)\) and there are at least two
elements, \(\sigma \neq \sigma'\), such that \((\sigma, -1) \in S_3\) and
\((\sigma', -1) \in S_3\). Both \(\sigma\) and \(\sigma'\) must be
transpositions; if \(\sigma\) were a 3-cycle, then \((\sigma, -1)^3\) would be
\((1, -1)\), which contradicts our assumption. But any two distinct
transpositions generate \(S_3\), so \(G\) must contain an element of the
form \((g_1, g_2)\) for every possible \(g_1\), and \(g_2\) will be \(+1\) if
\(g_1\) is even, \(-1\) otherwise. So \(G\) is just \(S_3\) together with
an extraneous sign bit.</li>
</ol>
<p>The possibilities for \(G\) are therefore \(S_3 \times S_2, S_3, C_3, C_2,
C_6, V\), and the trivial group.</p>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 6.11.6</span> The subspaces are generated by
(0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), and (1, 2). An invertible matrix will always map a
one-dimensional subspace to a one-dimensional subspace and this mapping is
injective. Therefore there exists
a homomorphism \(\varphi : GL_2(F) \to S_4\) where each invertible matrix is
mapped to the permutation it induces on these four subspaces. The kernel of
this homomorphism consists only of diagonal matrices since only a diagonal
matrix can both map (0, 1) to a multiple itself and also do likewise for
(1, 0). Furthermore, such a diagonal matrix has to be \(\diag(1, 1)\) or
\(\diag(2, 2)\) and not \(\diag(1, 2)\) or \(\diag(2, 1)\) as these would
exchange the (1, 1) and (1, 2) subspaces. Since the kernel has order 2,
the image of \(\varphi\) must have order \(|GL_2(F)|/2\). But
\(|GL_2(F)| = (3^2 - 1)(3^2 - 3) = 48\), which can be determined by observing
that an invertible matrix can have an arbitrary nonzero vector for its first
column and then the second column can be anything except a multiple of the
first column. So \(|\im \varphi| = 24\), which implies that the image is the
entire group \(S_4\).</p>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 6.11.7</span></p>
<ol class="subproblems">
<li>Suppose \(\varphi : D_4 \to S_n\) is injective. Then \(|S_n| \geq |D_4|\).
This implies \(n \geq 4\). It was previously established in
Exercise 6.11.3 that \(D_4\) acts faithfully on the vertices of
a square, so \(n = 4\).</li>
<li>Suppose \(\varphi : D_6 \to S_n\) is injective. Since \(D_6\) contains
elements of order 6, \(S_n\) must as well. This implies that \(n\) is at least
5 (all elements of \(S_4\) have order 1, 2, 3, or 4). Now consider the action
of \(D_6\) on the set \(\{E_1, E_2, E_3, F_1, F_2\}\) where the \(E\)'s are
the three long diagonals of a hexagon, \(F_1\) is a set of three alternating
sides of the hexagon, and \(F_2\) is the set of the other three sides.
Any reflection in \(D_6\) acts as a transposition on \(E_1, E_2, E_3\), so no
subsequent rotation, which acts as a 3-cycle on this set, can restore all three
diagonals to their original positions. Among proper rotations, only the 180
degree rotation fixes the three diagonals, but it exchanges \(F_1\) and
\(F_2\). Therefore the action we have defined is faithful, establishing that
\(n = 5\).</li>
<li>If \(\varphi : H \to S_n\) is injective, then \(\varphi(i)\) must have
order 4, therefore it must contain a 4-cycle. Thus far we know \(n \geq 4\).
Without loss of generality, say \(\varphi(i)\) contains the 4-cycle
\((1\ 2\ 3\ 4)\). Then \(\varphi(-1)\) contains the transpositions \((1\ 3)\)
and \((2\ 4)\). Now \(j^2 = -1\) also, so if \(j\) maps \(1\) to \(a\), then
it must map \(a\) to 3, and if it maps 3 to \(b\), then it must map \(b\) to 1;
that is, \(j\) must contain a 4-cycle \((1\ a\ 3\ b)\). It must also contain
a 4-cycle \((2\ c\ 4\ d)\) by similar reasoning. If these were the same cycle,
then the product of \(\varphi(i)\) and \(\varphi(j)\) would contain the
transpositions \((1\ 3)\) and \((2\ 4)\). But this product is \(\varphi(k)\),
and its square \(\varphi(-1)\) would then fix 1, 2, 3, and 4, which
contradicts our earlier assumptions. Likewise if they were inverse cycles to
each other then \(\varphi(k)\) would fix 1, 2, 3, and 4 and so would
\(\varphi(-1)\). Therefore, we know that the two 4-cycles in \(j\) must be
different, which requires \(n \geq 8\). The action of \(H\) on itself by
left-multiplication is a faithful action on a set of size 8. Therefore
\(n = 8\).</li>
</ol>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 6.11.8</span> We previously argued
(see <a href="/artin/2.4">Exercise 2.4.6</a> and <a href="/artin/2.6">Exercise
2.6.10</a>) that the automorphisms of \(C_n\) are precisely the functions
\(\varphi_k\) defined by \(\varphi_k(x) = kx\) for \(k\) relatively prime to
\(n\). In the case where \(n\) is a prime \(p\) there are therefore exactly
\(p-1\) automorphisms, each sending 1 to a different nonzero value.
\(\varphi_k\) are in bijective correspondence with the multiplicative group
\(\mathbb{F}_p^\times\) which also contains exactly the elements
\(1, 2, \ldots, p-1\). In fact, the set of automorphisms and the multiplicative
group are isomorphic as groups, where the isomorphism sends \(k \in
\mathbb{F}_p^\times\) to \(\varphi_k\). It is easy to verify that this is
indeed a group isomorphism.</p>
