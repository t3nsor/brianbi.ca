<h2>Section 7.10. Generators and Relations</h2>
<p><span class="problem">Exercise 7.10.1</span> Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be the
free group on a set of generators \(S\), and let \(f : S \to G\) be a function
from \(S\) to a group \(G\). It is clear that there is at most one way to
extend \(f\) to a group homomorphism \(\varphi : \mathcal{F} \to G\), since
\(S\) generates \(\mathcal{F}\), namely,
by writing each element of \(\mathcal{F}\) as a reduced word, replacing each
instance of a generator \(s \in S\) by \(f(s)\), and replacing each instance
of \(s^{-1}\) by \(f(s)^{-1}\), where \(s \in S\). We need to show that this is
indeed a valid homomorphism.
Let \(g_1, g_2\) be arbitrary elements of \(\mathcal{F}\); write them as
reduced words:
\begin{align*}
g_1 &amp;= s_1^{d_1} \ldots s_m^{d_m} \\
g_2 &amp;= t_1^{e_1} \ldots t_n^{e_n}
\end{align*}
so that
\begin{align}
\varphi(g_1) &amp;= f(s_1)^{d_1} \ldots f(s_m)^{d_m} \nonumber \\
\varphi(g_2) &amp;= f(t_1)^{e_1} \ldots f(t_n)^{e_n} \nonumber \\
\varphi(g_1) \varphi(g_2) &amp;= f(s_1)^{d_1} \ldots f(s_m)^{d_m}
f(t_1)^{e_1} \ldots f(t_n)^{e_n} \label{eqn:phig1g2}
\end{align}
Suppose that in forming the product \(g_1 g_2\) and reducing, we need to cancel
\(k\) factors from the right of \(g_1\) and \(k\) factors from the left of
\(g_2\). Then the reduced word form of \(g_1 g_2\) is
\[
g_1 g_2 = s_1^{d_1} \ldots s_{m-k}^{d_{m-k}} t_{k+1}^{e_{k+1}} \ldots t_n^{e_n}
\]
and
\[
\varphi(g_1 g_2) = f(s_1)^{d_1} \ldots f(s_{m-k})^{d_{m-k}}
f(t_{k+1})^{e_{k+1}} f(t_n)^{e_n}
\]
The cancellation implies that for each \(j\) from 1 to \(n\), we had
\(s_{m-j+1} = t_j\) and \(d_{m-j+1} = -e_j\). If that's the case, then it's
also true that \(f(s_{m-j+1})^{d_{m-j+1}} f(t_j)^{e_j} =
f(t_j)^{-e_j} f(t_j)^{e_j} = 1\). So we may cancel \(k\) pairs of factors in
\((\ref{eqn:phig1g2})\) to obtain
\[
\varphi(g_1)\varphi(g_2) = f(s_1)^{d_1} \ldots f(s_{m-k})^{d_{m-k}}
f(t_{k+1})^{e_{k+1}} \ldots f(t_n)^{e_n} = \varphi(g_1 g_2)
\]
as required. So \(\varphi\) is indeed a homomorphism.</p>
<p>We now turn our attention to the mapping property for free groups. Using the
notation in Proposition 7.10.13, we will prove that there is a unique
homomorphism \(\overline{\varphi} : \overline{G}' \to G\) such that
\(\varphi = \overline{\varphi} \circ \pi\).
The group \(\overline{G}'\) is the group of cosets of \(N\) in \(G'\).
For each \(C \in \overline{G}'\), there is some \(a \in G'\) such
that \(C = [aN]\), so that \(C = \pi(a)\). Since we have \(\varphi(a) =
\overline{\varphi}(\pi(a))\), this implies \(\overline{\varphi}(C) =
\varphi(a)\). So knowing \(\varphi\) allows us to deduce what
\(\overline{\varphi}\) must be. This is well-defined, because if
\(a, b \in G'\) belong to the same coset, then \(ab^{-1} \in N \subseteq K\),
so \(\varphi(a) = \varphi(b)\). By construction, it is therefore the case that
\(\varphi = \overline{\varphi} \circ \pi\) as required. It remains to show
that \(\overline{\varphi}\) is a homomorphism.
Let \(C_1, C_2 \in \overline{G}'\) and write \(C_1 = [a_1 N], C_2 =
[a_2 N]\). Then \(C_1 C_2 = [a_1 a_2 N]\), so \(\overline{\varphi}(C_1 C_2) =
\varphi(a_1 a_2) = \varphi(a_1) \varphi(a_2) = \overline{\varphi}(C_1)
\overline{\varphi}(C_2)\), as required. We have verified that
\(\overline{\varphi}\) is a homomorphism.</p>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 7.10.2</span> Let \(g \in G\). Then
\(\varphi(g)\) is a product of the generators \(\varphi(S)\), say,
\(\varphi(g) = \varphi(s_1)^{d_1} \ldots \varphi(s_m)^{d_m}\) where each
\(s_i\) is some element of \(S\) and each \(d_i\) is \(\pm 1\). This implies
\(\varphi(g) = \varphi(s_1^{d_1} \ldots s_m^{d_m})\). Since the elements
\(g\) and \(s_1^{d_1} \ldots s_m^{d_m}\) have the same image, it must be that
\(g = k s_1^{d_1} \ldots s_m^{d_m}\) for some \(k \in \ker \varphi\). But then
\(k = t_1^{e_1} \ldots t_n^{e_n}\) where each \(t_i \in T\) and each \(e_i\) is
\(\pm 1\). So \(g = t_1^{e_1} \ldots t_n^{e_n} s_1^{d_1} \ldots s_m^{d_m}\).
Since every \(g \in G\) can be written in this form,
\(S \cup T\) generates \(G\).</p>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 7.10.3</span> Yes. If \(G = \{g_1, \ldots,
g_n\}\) and the composition law is \(g_i g_j = g_{a_{ij}}\) for some matrix
\(a\), then a presentation of \(G\) is given by \(\langle g_1, \ldots,
g_n \mid g_i g_j g_{a_{ij}}^{-1} \rangle\) where \(i, j\) range over all pairs
of indices from 1 to \(n\). The assumption that \(G\) exists and satisfies
these relations establishes that
this presentation does indeed describe a group with at least \(n\) distinct
elements, and the relations themselves imply that that group is isomorphic to
\(G\).</p>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 7.10.4</span> We solve this problem in three
parts. First, we determine the normal closure \(N\) of \(xyx^{-1}y^{-1}\) in
\(\mathcal{F}\), the free group over two generators. Second, we characterize
the group \(G = \mathcal{F}/N\). Finally, we prove the universal property.</p>

<p>Define \(w : \mathcal{F} \to \mathbb{Z}^2\) as the homomorphism
with \(w(x) = (1, 0), w(y) = (0, 1)\). By the universal property, this
homomorphism exists and is unique, and simply counts occurrences of each
generator minus its inverse in the reduced word. We claim that \(\ker w
\subseteq N\),
that is, \(N\) contains all <em>balanced words</em>, which are reduced words
that have
the same number of \(x\)'s as \(x^{-1}\)'s and the same number of \(y\)'s as
\(y^{-1}\)'s. We prove the claim by induction on the length of the balanced
word, which must obviously be even.</p>

<p><em>Base case:</em> The only balanced word of length zero is the identity,
which is of course in \(N\). There are no balanced words of length two. We are
given that \(xyx^{-1}y^{-1} \in N\); successive conjugation by \(x^{-1},
y^{-1}, x\) yields the elements \(yx^{-1}y^{-1}x, x^{-1}y^{-1}xy,
y^{-1}xyx^{-1}\). The inverses of these four elements must also be in \(N\),
namely \(yxy^{-1}x^{-1}, x^{-1}yxy^{-1}, y^{-1}x^{-1}yx, xy^{-1}x^{-1}y\).
These eight words exhaust the balanced words of length four.</p>

<p><em>Inductive case:</em> Assume all balanced words of length less than
\(2n\) are in \(N\). We will use this to prove that all balanced words of
length \(2n\) are in \(N\) in the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Let \(a\) denote \(x\), \(y\), \(x^{-1}\), or \(y^{-1}\). If a balanced
word of length \(2n\) has the form \(aWa^{-1}\), then \(W\) must also be
balanced; by the
induction hypothesis, \(W \in N\); therefore \(aWa^{-1} \in N\) also. That is,
all balanced words of the form \(aWa^{-1}\) of length \(2n\) are in \(N\).</li>
<li>If a balanced word of length \(2n\) has the form \(a W_1 a^{-1} W_2\) where
the length of
\(W_2\) is at most \(n-2\), then \(a W_1 a^{-1} W_2 =
(a W_1 W_2 a^{-1})(a W_2^{-1} a^{-1} W_2)\). By step 1, the left factor is in
\(N\). The right factor is balanced, and has length at most \(2(n-1)\). By the
induction hypothesis, the right factor is in \(N\). Therefore all balanced
\(a W_1 a^{-1} W_2 \in N\).</li>
<li>If a balanced word of length \(2n\) has the form \(a W_1 a^{-1} W_2\) where
the length of \(W_1\) is at most \(n-2\), then note that by step 2, the
balanced word \(a^{-1} W_2 a W_1^{-1}\) is in \(N\), and
\(a W_1 a^{-1} W_2\) is the conjugate of that element by \(a W_1\). Therefore
\(a W_1 a^{-1} W_2 \in N\).</li>
<li>If a balanced word of length \(2n\) has the form \(W_1 a W_2 a^{-1} W_3\),
where the length of \(W_2\) is not \(n-1\), then note that by steps 1 and 2,
the balanced word \(a W_2 a^{-1} W_3 W_1^{-1}\) is in \(N\), and the word
\(W_1 a W_2 a^{-1} W_3\) is the conjugate of that word by \(W_1\). Therefore
\(W_1 a W_2 a^{-1} W_3 \in N\).</li>
<li>If a balanced word of length \(2n\) is not covered by case 4, it can only
take the form \(W = a_1 a_2 \ldots a_n a_1^{-1} a_2^{-1} \ldots
a_n^{-1}\). Note that the word \(W'\) formed by swapping the initial \(a_1\)
and \(a_2\) is then covered by case 4 so \(W' \in N\); finally
\(W = (a_1 a_2 a_1^{-1} a_2^{-1})W'\), and \(a_1 a_2 a_1^{-1} a_2^{-1} \in N\)
by the base case \(n = 2\), therefore \(W \in N\).</li>
</ol>
<p>We have proven that \(\ker w \in N\). But \(\ker w\) is normal, so
\(N = \ker w\).</p>

<p>Now let's turn our attention to the structure of \(G\). By the first
isomorphism theorem, \(G = \mathcal{F}/N\) is isomorphic to \(\im w\), which is
simply \(\mathbb{Z}^2\) itself. Explicitly, the elements of \(G\) are fibers
of \(w\), so this isomorphism maps \([xN]\) to \((1, 0)\) and \([yN]\) to
\((0, 1)\). In the group \(G\), the symbol \(x\) denotes the coset \([xN]\)
and \(y\) denotes \([yN]\). So we can also say that \(G\) is isomorphic to
\(\mathbb{Z}^2\) with \(x\) mapped to \((1, 0)\) and \(y\) mapped to
\((0, 1)\).</p>

<p>We can finally prove the universal property. Let an abelian group \(A\) be
given and let \(u, v \in A\). We know that \(x, y\) generate \(G\) because
\((1, 0), (0, 1)\) generate \(\mathbb{Z}^2\). Therefore there is at most one
homomorphism \(\varphi : G \to A\) with \(\varphi(x) = u, \varphi(y) = v\). To
show that \(\varphi\) actually exists and is a homomorphism, define it as
\(\varphi = \gamma \circ \varphi'\) where
\(\varphi'\) is the isomorphism from \(G\) to \(\mathbb{Z}^2\) and
\(\gamma\) is the homomorphism defined by \(\gamma((1, 0)) = u,
\gamma((0, 1)) = v\). It is obvious that \(\gamma\) is a valid homomorphism,
therefore \(\varphi\) is also a valid homomorphism, as required.</p>
<div class="qed"></div>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 7.10.5</span> Idea: Let \(G\) denote the
group specified. Notice that the defining
relation \(yxyz^{-2} = 1\) is equivalent to \(x = y^{-1}z^2y^{-1}\). Define a
homomorphism \(\varphi : G \to \mathcal{F}(y, z)\) as follows: to compute
\(G(w)\) for some reduced word \(w\), replace every occurrence of \(x\) with
\(y^{-1}z^2 y^{-1}\) and every occurrence of \(x^{-1}\) with \(yz^{-2}y\), and
cancel to obtain a reduced word. Argue that the result doesn't depend on the
order of substitutions and cancellations, and use this to show that
\(\varphi\) is a homomorphism. Argue that the normal closure \(N\) of the
defining relation \(x^{-1}y^{-1}z^2y^{-1}\) is \(\ker \varphi\), and by the
first isomorphism theorem, \(G = \mathcal{F}(x, y, z)/N \cong \im \varphi =
\mathcal{F}(y, z)\). Details are left as an exercise.</p>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 7.10.6</span></p>
<ol class="subproblems">
<li>Let \(H\) be a characteristic subgroup of \(G\). Then \(H\) is carried to
itself by all inner automorphisms, which are simply conjugation by the various
elements of \(G\). Therefore \(H\) is normal. To see that the centre is normal,
observe that if \(x\) is central and \(\varphi\) is an automorphism, then for
all \(y \in G\), \(\varphi(x)y =
\varphi(x)\varphi(\varphi^{-1}(y)) = \varphi(x\varphi^{-1}(y)) =
\varphi(\varphi^{-1}(y)x) = y\varphi(x)\), therefore \(\varphi(x)\) is also
central. Applying this logic using the inverse automorphism establishes that
the converse is also true, so the centre must be carried to itself.</li>
<li><p>\(Q_8\) has the trivial group and \(Q_8\) itself as normal subgroups. We
can classify the remaining normal subgroups based on whether they contain an
element of order 4. If such a subgroup doesn't contain an element of order 4,
it can only be the \(C_2\) subgroup consisting of \(\pm 1\). If it does contain
an element of order 4, it must either be the group generated by that element or
the entire group, by Lagrange's theorem. But all subgroups generated by an
element of order 4 are
normal since they have index 2 in \(Q_8\). So all six subgroups of \(Q_8\),
namely the trivial group, \(Q_8\), \(\langle -1\rangle\),
\(\langle i \rangle\), \(\langle j \rangle\), and \(\langle k \rangle\), are
normal.</p>
<p>Only three of those subgroups are characteristic. Obviously the trivial
group and \(Q_8\) itself are characteristic; \(\{1, -1\}\) is characteristic
because \(-1\) is the only element of order 2. The subgroups of order 4 are
not characteristic; for example, the automorphism that sends \(i, j, k\) to
\(j, k, i\) respectively permutes those three subgroups in a 3-cycle.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 7.10.7</span> Let \([x, y]\) denote the
commutator of \(x\) and \(y\). It is easy to see that if \(\varphi\) is any
homomorphism, then \(\varphi([x, y]) = [\varphi(x), \varphi(y)]\). Also note
that \([x, y] = [y, x]^{-1}\). Suppose
now that \(\varphi\) is an automorphism and that \(g \in C\). Then we can write
\(g\) in the form \([x_1, y_1][x_2, y_2] \ldots [x_n, y_n]\) where all
\(x_i\)'s and \(y_i\)'s are elements of \(G\). (We don't need any inverses here
since we can just exchange the two elements in the commutator, but the
argument doesn't depend on this.) Then \(\varphi(g) =
\varphi([x_1, y_1]) \ldots \varphi([x_n, y_n]) = [\varphi(x_1), \varphi(y_1)]
\ldots [\varphi(x_n), \varphi(y_n)]\), therefore \(\varphi(g) \in C\) also.
By applying this logic to the inverse automorphism \(\varphi^{-1}\) we can
establish the converse also. So \(C\) is characteristic in \(G\).</p>
<p>To show that \(G/C\) is abelian, we will work with the cosets directly.
Let \([xC], [yC]\) be two elements of \(G/C\). Then \([xC][yC] = [xyC]\) and
\([yC][xC] = [yxC]\). But \(C\) contains the element \([x^{-1}, y^{-1}] =
x^{-1}y^{-1}xy\), so \([yxC]\) contains \(yxx^{-1}y^{-1}xy = xy\), so these
two cosets are equal. Since \([xC], [yC]\) were arbitrary, \(G/C\) is
abelian.</p>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 7.10.8</span></p>
<ol class="subproblems">
<li>The group \(SO(2)\) is abelian, so its derived subgroup is trivial.</li>
<li>Let \(x, y \in O(2)\). The commutator \([x, y]\) must lie in the
\(SO(2)\) subgroup because in \(xyx^{-1}y^{-1}\) any reversal of orientation
caused by \(x\) will be undone by \(x^{-1}\) and likewise with \(y\) and
\(y^{-1}\). If \(z = \rho_{\theta}\), then a quick calculation shows that
\(z = [\rho_{\theta/2}, r]\). So \([SO(2), SO(2)] = SO(2)\).</li>
<li>As in part (b), it is clear that all commutators are
orientation-preserving, and according to part (b), \([M, M]\) contains all
rotations. Let \(t_a\) be a rotation and let \(r\) be the reflection
that maps \(a\) to \(-a\), that is, a reflection across the line perpendicular
to the vector \(a\).
 A quick calculation shows that \([t_a, r] = t_{2a}\), so \([M, M]\)
contains all translations too. Since the translations and
rotations generate the orientation-preserving subgroup of \(M\), that subgroup
is \([M, M]\).</li>
<li>The cases \(n = 1\) and \(n = 2\) are trivial. By a similar argument to
that of part (b), the commutators of \(S_n\) must
all be even permutations, so \([S_n, S_n] \subseteq A_n\).
Let \(x = (1\ 2), y = (2\ 3)\). Then \([x, y] = (1\ 2)(2\ 3)
(1\ 2)(2\ 3) = (1\ 2\ 3)(1\ 2\ 3) = (1\ 3\ 2)\). It is clear by analogy that
every 3-cycle is a commutator in \(S_n\). By Lemma 7.5.5(a), \(A_n\) is
generated by the 3-cycles. So \([S_n, S_n] = A_n\).</li>
<li>Let
\[
X = \begin{pmatrix}
\cos \theta &amp; -\sin\theta &amp; 0 \\
\sin\theta &amp; \cos\theta &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1
\end{pmatrix} \qquad
Y = \begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; -1
\end{pmatrix}
\]
That is, \(X\) is a rotation of angle \(\theta\) around the z-axis, while
\(Y\) is a rotation of 180 degrees around the x-axis. Calculation shows that
\[
[X, Y] = \begin{pmatrix}
\cos 2\theta &amp; -\sin 2\theta &amp; 0 \\
\sin 2\theta &amp; \cos 2\theta &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1
\end{pmatrix}
\]
So we see that \([SO(3), SO(3)]\) contains all rotations around the z-axis.
But by Exercises 7.10.7 and 7.10.6(a), the derived subgroup is normal, so it
contains all conjugates of rotations around the z-axis, and by Corollary
5.1.28(b), this includes all rotations in \(SO(3)\). Therefore
\([SO(3), SO(3)] = SO(3)\).</li>
</ol>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 7.10.9</span> We found in
<a href="/artin/2.12">Exercise 2.12.2</a> that the centre of the group \(G\)
consists of all those matrices of the form
\[
\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; x \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix}
\]
where \(x\) is an arbitrary element of the ground field; this did not depend on
choice of field.</p>
<p>Direct calculation shows that
\[
\left[\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; a &amp; b \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; c \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix},
\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; d &amp; e \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; f \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix} \right] =
\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; af - cd \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix}
\]
so in fact \([G, G] = Z(G)\).</p>
<p>Finally, direct calculation shows, and induction can easily be used to
prove, that
\[
\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; a &amp; b \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; c \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix}^n =
\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; na &amp; nb + \binom{n}{2}ac \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; nc \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix}
\]
For
\(p &gt; 2\), the order of any element where either \(a\) or \(c\) is nonzero
is at least \(p\) since we need \(na = nc = 0\), and \(p\) divides
\(\binom{p}{2}\) so
the condition that \(nb + \binom{n}{2}ac = 0\) is then satisfied as well, and
the order
is exactly \(p\). Also if \(a = c = 0\) then it is clear the order is also
\(p\). So for \(p &gt; 2\), all elements have order \(p\) except the identity.
For \(p = 2\), this argument fails since \(\binom{2}{2} = 1\), which isn't a
multiple of 2.
This only matters in the case where \(ac \neq 0\). So the two matrices
\[
\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix}, \qquad
\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix}
\]
have order 4 while all other non-identity matrices have order 2.
