<p><span class="problem">Exercise 2.2.2</span> Clearly 1 is invertible since
\(1\cdot 1 = 1\). If \(a \in S\) is invertible with inverse \(a^{-1}\), then
\(a\) is also the inverse of \(a^{-1}\), so \(a^{-1}\) is invertible too. And
if \(a, b \in S\) are invertible, then \(ab\) is invertible with inverse
\(b^{-1} a^{-1}\). This establishes that the set of invertible elements of
\(S\) with law of composition inherited from \(S\) is a group.</p>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 2.2.3</span></p>
<ol class="subproblems">
<li>Multiply both sides by \(x^{-1}\) on the left and \(w^{-1}z\) on the right
to obtain \(y = x^{-1}w^{-1}z\).</li>
<li>Yes, \(yzx = x^{-1}(xyz)x = x^{-1}(1)x = 1\). No, it isn't necessarily the
case that \(yxz = 1\). For example, in \(S_3\), we have \(x \cdot y \cdot
xy = 1\), but \(y \cdot x \cdot xy = x \neq 1\).</li>
</ol>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 2.2.4</span></p>
<ol class="subproblems">
<li>Yes. \(H\) is itself a group under the same operation as \(G\) and is a
subset of \(G\), therefore \(H\) is a subgroup of \(G\).</li>
<li>Yes. \(H\) contains the identity element 1; the elements 1 and
-1 are their own inverses; and \(H\) is closed under multiplication.</li>
<li>No. \(H\) doesn't contain the identity element 0.</li>
<li>Yes. \(H\) contains the identity element 1; the inverse of a positive real
is another positive real; and the positive reals are closed under 
multiplication.</li>
<li>No. \(H\) doesn't contain the identity matrix.</li>
</ol>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 2.2.5</span> If \(1_H\) is the identity of
\(H\), then it must be the case that \(1_H 1_H = 1_H\). When this is regarded
as an equality in \(G\), we can cancel \(1_H\) from both sides to obtain
\(1_H = 1_G\). Analogously, if \(a \in H\) and \(a^*\) denotes the inverse of
\(a\) in \(H\), then \(aa^* = 1_H = 1_G\). Left-multiplying both sides by the
element \(a^{-1}\) (the inverse of \(a\) in \(G\)) yields \(a^* = a^{-1}\).

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 2.2.6</span> The element 1 is the identity in
\(G^\circ\) since \(1*a = a1 = a\) and \(a*1 = 1a = a\) for all \(a \in
G^\circ\). If \(a \in G^\circ\) then the inverse element \(a^{-1}\) in \(G\)
is also the inverse in \(G^\circ\) since \(a*a^{-1} = a^{-1}a = 1\) and
\(a^{-1}*a = aa^{-1} = 1\). If \(a, b, c \in G^\circ\) then
\(a*(b*c) = (b*c)a = (cb)a = c(ba) = (ba)*c = (a*b)*c\), so \(*\) is
associative. We conclude that \((G^\circ, *)\) is a group.</p>
