<p><span class="problem">Exercise 15.1.1</span> Let \(r\) be a nonzero element
of \(R\). The map \(\varphi : R \to R\) given by \(\varphi(x) = rx\) is an
\(F\)-linear endomorphism. If \(\varphi\) is surjective, then \(x\) has an
inverse in \(R\). If \(\varphi\) is not surjective, then since the dimension is
finite, \(\ker \varphi\) is nontrivial, implying \(R\) is not an integral
domain.</p>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 15.1.2</span> Suppose \(x =
\frac{-b+\delta}{2}\). Then
\begin{align*}
x^2 + bx + c
&amp;= \frac{b^2 - 2b\delta + \delta^2}{4} + \frac{-b^2+b\delta}{2} + c \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{4} (b^2 - 2b\delta + b^2 - 4c - 2b^2 + 2b\delta + 4c) \\
&amp;= 0
\end{align*}
Conversely, suppose \(x^2 + bx + c\) splits over \(F\). Complete the square to
obtain \((x + b/2)^2  = b^2/4 - c\). There is some \(x \in F\) that solves this
equation. Let \(\delta = 2x + b\). Then \(\delta^2 = 4(b^2/4 - c) =
b^2 - 4c\).</p>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 15.1.3</span> The subfields of \(\C\) that
are contained with \(\R\) are obviously not dense subsets of \(\C\). We claim
that the converse is also true. Let \(K\) be a subfield of \(\C\) and suppose
\(K\) contains the element \(z_0 \notin \R\). Then \(\{1, z_0\}\) is an
\(\R\)-basis of \(\C\).
Now \(K\) must contain the rational numbers as well as all rational multiples
of \(z_0\). Let \(z \in \C\) be given and write \(z = a + bz_0\) where
\(a, b \in \R\). If \(r, s \in \Q\), then \(r + sz_0 \in K\). By choosing
\(r\) and \(s\) to be arbitrarily close to \(a\) and \(b\), respectively, we
can make \(r + sz_0\) arbitrarily close to \(z\). Therefore \(K\) is dense in
\(\C\).</p>
