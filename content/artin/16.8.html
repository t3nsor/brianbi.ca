<h2>Section 16.8. Cubic Equations</h2>
<p><span class="problem">Exercise 16.8.1</span> (Why is this problem in this
section?) The group \(V_4\) has three subgroups of order 2. This implies that
there are three intermediate fields \(L_1, L_2, L_3\) with degree 2 over \(F\).
We are assuming characteristic zero, so by Proposition 15.3.3, these
intermediate fields are generated by square roots: \(L_i = F(\sqrt{\delta_i})\)
with \(\delta_i \in F\) for \(i = 1, 2, 3\). The field
\(F(\sqrt{\delta_1}, \sqrt{\delta_2})\) contains both \(L_1\) and \(L_2\) and
is contained within \(K\), so the only possibility is that it is a quadratic
extension of each of \(L_1\) and \(L_2\), and equal to \(K\). Thus, we have
constructed \(K\) by adjoining to \(F\) the square roots of two elements.</p>
<p>Each subgroup of \(V_4\) of order 2 is the fixed field of one of the
intermediate fields \(L_i\). Obviously a subgroup of order 2 contains the
identity and one of the three non-identity elements of \(V_4\); for each of the
intermediate fields \(L_i\), there is therefore exactly one nontrivial element
of \(G\) that fixes \(\sqrt{\delta_i}\), which is a primitive element for the
extension \(L_i/F\). Thus, the three nontrivial elements of \(G\) can be
labelled \(\sigma_1, \sigma_2, \sigma_3\) where \(\sigma_i\) fixes only
\(\sqrt{\delta_i}\). Its action on \(\sqrt{\delta_j}\) where \(j \ne i\) must
be to take it to \(-\sqrt{\delta_j}\), since an \(F\)-automorphism must take a
root of \(x^2 - \delta_j\) to another root.</p>

<ol class="subproblems">
<li>By (16.2.8), the discriminant is \(-108\), which is not a square in \(\Q\),
so by Theorem 16.8.5, the Galois group is \(S_3\).</li>
<li>If this polynomial splits over \(\Q\), it must have a root that divides 14.
Using this fact, we find the factorization \((x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 7)\).  The
quadratic factor is irreducible over \(\Q\), so the Galois group is \(C_2\).
(For the remaining polynomials in this exercise, the same test can be used to
determine that they are irreducible over \(\Q\).)</li>
<li>Upon making the substitution \(x = y + 1\), the cubic is transformed into
the cubic \(y^3 - 3y - 1\), which has the same discriminant. We can now
explicitly evaluate the discriminant using (16.2.8); it is \(81\), which is a
square in \(\Q\), so the Galois group is \(A_3\).</li>
<li>The discriminant is \(35721\), which is a square in \(\Q\), so
the Galois group is \(A_3\).</li>
<li>We make the substitution \(x = y - 1/3\), and the cubic becomes
\(y^3 - 7y/3 - 7/27\), which has discriminant 49, which is a square in \(\Q\),
so the Galois group is \(A_3\).</li>
<li>Using the same substitution as in (e), we must end up with the cubic
\(y^3 - 7y/3 + 47/27\), which has discriminant \(-31\), which is not a square
in \(\Q\), so the Galois group is \(S_3\).</li>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 16.8.3</span> The quadratic in (16.8.2) can
be determined by performing polynomial long division of \(x^3 - a_1 x^2 +
a_2 x - a_3\) by \(x - \beta_1\) (I changed the symbol for the roots from
\(\alpha\) to \(\beta\) so it would be less confusing) and assuming that the
remainder is zero since \(\beta_1\) is assumed to be a root. The result is
\(x^2 + (\beta_1 - a_1) x + (\beta_1^2 - a_1\beta_1 + a_2)\). Another way to
obtain this result is to solve for the coefficients of the quadratic using
the expressions for \(a_1, a_2, a_3\) in terms of the roots \(\beta_1,
\beta_2, \beta_3\) and the knowledge that the roots of the quadratic will be
\(\beta_2, \beta_3\).</p>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 16.8.4</span> Let \(f(x) = x^3 + 2x + 1\)
and \(g(x) = x^3 + x + 1\). By the rational root test, both \(f\) and \(g\)
have no roots in \(\Q\), so they are irreducible over \(\Q\). Let \(\alpha_1,
\alpha_2, \alpha_3\) denote the roots of \(f\) in its splitting field
\(L \subseteq \C\). The discriminant of \(f\) is \(-59\), so \([L : \Q] = 6\).
Let \(\beta\) be a root of \(g\) in \(\C\). Assume for the sake of
contradiction that \(\beta \in L\). Since \(L\) is a splitting field over
\(\Q\), \(g\) must split completely in \(L\). Therefore \(L\) must contain
the square root of the discriminant of \(g\), that is, \(\sqrt{-31}\). But
\(L\) also contains \(\sqrt{-59}\), so \(L\) must contain a subfield with
degree 4 over \(\Q\), namely \(\Q(\sqrt{-31}, \sqrt{-59})\). Since 4 doesn't
divide 6, a contradiction has been reached. So our assumption that \(g\) has
a root in \(L\) must have been false. Since \(g\) doesn't have a root in \(L\),
it cannot have a root in the subfield \(\Q(\alpha)\) either.</p>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 16.8.5</span> To make the problem
interesting, we have to assume that Artin intended for square roots and
irrational constants to be disallowed: that is, we must show explicitly that
\(\alpha_2, \alpha_3 \in \Q(\alpha_1, \delta)\). The approach to do this is
described <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/a/798975/24692">here</a>,
although I believe the final result is wrong. Doing the algebra, we obtain
\[
\alpha_{2,3} = -\frac{\alpha_1}{2}\left(1 \pm \frac{\delta}{2p\alpha_1 + 3q}
\right)
\]</p>
