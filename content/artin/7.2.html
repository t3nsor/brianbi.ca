<h2>Section 7.2. The Class Equation</h2>
<p class="lemma">Let \(G\) be a finite nonabelian group and let
\(C\) be one of its conjugacy classes. Then \(|G|/|Z(G)| = k|C|\) for some
integer \(k &gt; 1\).</p>
<p class="proof">If \(|C| = 1\) then this is immediate. Otherwise, let
\(x \in C\); it is clear that \(x \notin Z(G)\). Then \(|C| = |G|/|Z(x)|\).
But \(Z(x)\) contains at least one element that is not in \(Z(G)\), namely
\(x\) itself. By Lagrange's theorem, \(|Z(x)| = k|Z(G)|\) for some integer
\(k &gt; 1\). The desired result follows.</p>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 7.2.1</span></p>
<ol class="subproblems">
<li>Write
\[
P = \begin{pmatrix} a &amp; b \\ c &amp; d \end{pmatrix} \qquad
A = \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix}
\]
Then
\begin{align*}
PA &amp;= \begin{pmatrix} a &amp; a+b \\ c &amp; c + d \end{pmatrix} \\
AP &amp;= \begin{pmatrix} a+c &amp; b+d \\ c &amp; d \end{pmatrix}
\end{align*}
therefore \(AP = PA\) iff \(c = 0, a = d\). Therefore \(\det P = a^2\), and
there are two choices for \(a\) and three for \(b\). The centralizer of \(A\)
therefore has order 6. The order of \(GL_2(\mathbb{F}_3)\) is
\((3^2 - 1)(3^2 - 3) = 48\), so the conjugacy class of \(A\) has order 8.</li>
<li>We previously found (<a href="/artin/6.7">Exercise 6.7.10(b)</a>) that
the centralizer has order 16 and the orbit has size 20.</li>
</ol>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 7.2.2</span> The centralizer of \(x\) has
order \(21 \div 3 = 7\). Now the subgroup generated by \(x\) is a subgroup of
the centralizer, so the former must have order 1 or 7. It can't have order
1 because then \(x\) would be the identity, whose conjugacy class contains only
itself. Therefore \(x\) has order 7.</p>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 7.2.3</span> Let \(x\) be a member of the
conjugacy class of order 4. Then the centralizer \(Z(x)\) has order 3. The
centre \(Z(G)\) is a subgroup of \(Z(x)\), so the former must have order 1 or
3. Suppose \(Z(G)\) has order 3; then \(Z(G) = Z(x)\). But \(Z(x)\) must
also have \(\langle x \rangle\) as a subgroup, which must also have order 3,
so \(Z(G) = \langle x \rangle\). If this were the case, then \(x\) would have a
conjugacy class of size 1, which is a contradiction. Thus, \(Z(G)\) can only
be trivial.</p>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 7.2.4</span> If \(x = gyg^{-1}\), then
\(x^n = (gyg^{-1})^n = gy^ng^{-1}\). That is, two conjugate elements of \(G\)
are mapped by \(\varphi\) to two conjugate elements of \(G\), or, put another
way, the image of each conjugacy class of \(G\) under \(\varphi\) is contained
within a single conjugacy class. Moreover, for every \(x \in G\), the mapping
\(\varphi: C(x) \to C(x^n)\) is surjective, since every \(gx^ng^{-1} \in
C(x^n)\) occurs as \((gxg^{-1})^n\). It is not necessarily injective, however;
for example, for \(n = |G|\), conjugacy classes of all sizes will be mapped
onto \(\{1\}\).</p>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 7.2.7</span> The class equation \(1 + 1 + 1
+ 2 + 5\) describes a group whose centre has order 3, which doesn't divide
10, so this is impossible. The class equation \(1 + 2 + 3 + 4\) is also
impossible because a group of order 10 can't have a conjugacy class of order 3,
again because 3 doesn't divide 10. The class equation \(1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2\)
is ruled out by the Lemma.  Finally, the class equation \(1 + 2 + 2 + 5\) is
actually valid; it is the class equation of \(D_5\). (This claim can be
verified by straightforward computation; see Exercise 7.2.9(c).)</p>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 7.2.8</span></p>
<ol class="subproblems">
<li>The class equation for a group of order 8 can only contain the numbers 1,
2, 4, and 8. It must contain 1, so it can't contain 8. The number of 1's must
divide 8. The class equation \(1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1\) describes an
abelian group. If there are four ones, then the class equation must be
\(1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2\) or \(1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4\). Both of these can are
ruled out by the Lemma. The class equation can't contain only one one
(Proposition 7.3.1). So it must contain two ones and be either
\(1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2\) or \(1 + 1 + 2 + 4\). The latter is ruled out by the
Lemma. Thus, a nonabelian group of order 8 can only have class equation
\(1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2\). As long as there exists a nonabelian group of order 8,
its class equation must be \(1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2\). And we know of two examples
of such groups, namely \(D_4\) and the quaternion group.</li>
<li>The class equation can only contain the numbers 1, 3, and 7, and not all
the numbers can be 1 for a nonabelian group. If the centre has order 7, then
by inspection, the only possible class equation is \(1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1
+ 7 + 7\), but this is ruled out by the Lemma. Now
consider if the centre has order 3; again, by inspection, the only possible
class equation is \(1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3\). This is also ruled out
by the Lemma.  The only remaining possibility that we haven't ruled out is
that the centre is trivial, so the remaining numbers sum to 20. By inspection,
the only possible class equation is then \(1 + 3 + 3 + 7 + 7\); if any
nonabelian group of order 21 exists, this must be its class equation. It isn't
obvious that such a group exists; it can be found by trial and error, or
constructed as the semidirect product \(C_7 \rtimes C_3\), which hasn't been
covered yet at this point in the text.</li>
</ol>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 7.2.9</span></p>
<ol class="subproblems">
<li>We argued in Exercise 7.2.8(a) that a nonabelian group of order 8 must have
the class equation \(1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2\).</li>
<li>Ditto.</li>
<li>The five reflections in \(D_5\) are all conjugate to each other, since
\(\rho^k r \rho^{-k} = \rho^k \rho^k r = \rho^{2k} r\) and the five choices of
\(k\) each give a different reflection \(\rho^{2k}r\). A rotation
can't be conjugate to a reflection, because the conjugate of an
orientation-preserving element of \(D_5\) must be orientation-preserving
(if the conjugation is by an orientation-reversing element, both that element
and its inverse will reverse orientation, so these two reversals will cancel).
The identity element belongs to its own conjugacy class. We claim that
\(\rho\) and \(\rho^4\) form a conjugacy class. To see this, observe that
\(r \rho r^{-1} = \rho^{-1} r r = \rho^{-1}\) and likewise \(r \rho^{-1} r^{-1}
= \rho\). The rotations all commute with each other, so the conjugation of
\(\rho\) by another rotation is just \(\rho\). And \(\rho, r\) generate
\(D_5\), so if conjugation by these two elements fixes the subset
\(\{\rho, \rho^4\}\), then conjugation by the entire group \(D_5\) does also.
A similar argument establishes that \(\{\rho^2, \rho^3\}\) is a conjugacy
class. In conclusion, the class equation is \(1 + 2 + 2 + 5\).</li>
<li>Let \(G\) be the group so described. The order of \(G\) is 12, since we
can choose any nonzero value for the top-left entry, any nonzero value for the
bottom-right entry, and any value for the top-right entry. It is known that
the diagonal elements of the product of two upper triangular matrices are just
the products of the corresponding diagonal entries in the two factors. This
implies that conjugate elements of \(G\) match along the diagonal. Divide
\(G\) up into 4 subsets \(\{G_{ab} \mid a, b \in \{1, 2\}\}\) where
\(G_{ab}\) consists of the three matrices with top-left entry \(a\) and
bottom-right entry \(b\). Each \(G_{ab}\) must be a union of conjugacy classes.
We now compute the centre of \(G\). A quick calculation shows that the two
matrices \(\begin{pmatrix} a &amp; b \\ 0 &amp; c \end{pmatrix}\) and
\(\begin{pmatrix} d &amp; e \\ 0 &amp; f \end{pmatrix}\) commute iff
\(b(d-f) = e(a-c)\). This implies that if \(b = a - c = 0\), then the first
matrix is central. If either \(b\) or \(a - c\) is nonzero, then we can always
choose some \(e, d-f\) that don't satisfy this equation, and we can always
construct some matrix in \(G\) with those \(e\) and \(d-f\) values. The centre
of \(G\) therefore consists of the two diagonal matrices \(I, 2I\). Since the
two elements of \(G_{11}\) other than \(I\) aren't central, they must be
contained in conjugacy classes of order at least 2, which implies that those
two elements form a single conjugacy class. The same holds for the two elements
of \(G_{22}\) other than \(2I\). The three elements of \(G_{12}\) must form a
single conjugacy class since there is no other way to partition a set of 3
elements without using any singleton; likewise the three elements of \(G_{21}\)
must form a single conjugacy class. In conclusion, the class equation of \(G\)
is \(1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 3\).</li>
</ol>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 7.2.12</span> Suppose \(G\) has only one
conjugacy class. The identity element always forms its own conjugacy class,
so \(G\) must be the trivial group. Now suppose \(G\) has exactly two
conjugacy classes. Then the class equation of \(G\) must be \(1 + x\), where
\(x\) divides the order of the group \(1 + x\). This can only occur when \(x
= 1\), so \(G \cong C_2\). Finally, suppose \(G\) has exactly three conjugacy
classes. Write the class equation as \(1 + x + y\), with \(x \le y\). If
\(x = 1\), then the order of the group is \(2 + y\), which must be a multiple
of \(y\), therefore \(y\) can only be 1 or 2. The class equation \(1 + 1 + 1\)
is that of \(C_3\), whereas the class equation \(1 + 1 + 2\) is impossible
by an argument used in Exercise 7.2.8. Now consider \(x &gt; 1\). We must
have \(y \divides 1 + x + y\), so \(1 + x + y\) is at least \(2y\). If
\(1 + x + y \ge 3y\), then this contradicts \(x \le y\). So \(1 + x + y = 2y\),
or \(y = 1 + x\). The order of the group is then \(2 + 2x\). If \(x \divides
2 + 2x\) and \(x &gt; 1\), then \(x\) can only be 2, corresponding to the
class equation \(1 + 2 + 3\). We previously classified groups of order 6 and
found that the only nonabelian group of order 6 is \(S_3\). We conclude that
the only finite groups with at most three conjugacy classes are \(C_1, C_2,
C_3, S_3\).</p>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 7.2.13</span> A normal subgroup is a union
of conjugacy classes. The group \(G\) has odd order so its class equation can't
contain the numbers 2 or 4. \(N\) is therefore a union of conjugacy classes
that have sizes 1, 3, or 5. One of these must have size 1, so none can have
size 5. The only two ways to write 5 as a sum of 1's and 3's are 1, 1, 1, 1, 1
and 1, 1, 3. We claim that the case 1, 1, 3 is impossible. If \(N\) were a
union of conjugacy classes of sizes 1, 1, 3, then let \(n\) be the element that
belongs to the singleton that doesn't contain the identity. That is, \(n\) is
central in \(G\). Since \(N\) has
order 5, it must be cyclic, so the remaining three elements are \(n^2, n^3,
n^4\). But these would also be central in \(G\), which contradicts them forming
a conjugacy class of order 3. From this we see that the only possibility is
1, 1, 1, 1, 1: each element of \(N\) belongs to its own conjugacy class in
\(G\), that is, \(N\) is contained in the centre of \(G\).</p>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 7.2.14</span></p>
<ol class="subproblems">
<li>Yes, since \(G\) has order 20 and has a conjugacy class of order 4, it must
have some centralizer subgroup with order 5. Now, a subgroup of order 5 is
necessarily the subgroup generated by some element of order 5 in \(G\). If
\(x \in G\) belongs to a conjugacy class of size 5, then its centralizer has
order 4 and contains the subgroup generated by \(x\), therefore \(x\) can't
have order 5. The only elements of \(G\) that can possibly have order 5 are
therefore the four elements of the single conjugacy class of size 4. We know
there are at least four elements of \(G\) with order 5 since we already know
\(G\) has a subgroup of order 5; therefore the four elements in the conjugacy
class of size 4 are precisely the set of elements of order 4 in \(G\). This
implies that there is exactly one subgroup of \(G\) with order 5, since any
such subgroup has to contain 4 elements of \(G\) that have order 4. Since there
is only one subgroup of \(G\) with order 5, any conjugate to this subgroup has
to be that subgroup itself. Therefore the subgroup of order 5 is normal.</li>
<li>Yes, since \(G\) has order 20 and has a conjugacy class of order 5, it must
have some centralizer subgroup with order 4. Now a normal subgroup of \(G\)
would consist of a union of conjugacy classes, one of which has size 1, so its
order would be the sum of some terms in \(G\)'s class equation including 1.
This can't be 4, so \(G\) has no normal subgroup of order 4.</li>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 7.2.16</span> For every \(g \in G\),
\(\varphi(gxg^{-1}) = \varphi(g)\varphi(x)\varphi(g)^{-1}\)  lies in
the conjugacy class of \(\varphi(x)\). Moreover, every element of \(C'\) takes
the form \(g'\varphi(x)g'^{-1}\) where \(g' \in G'\). For such an element, let
\(g \in G\) be such that \(\varphi(g) = g'\); we know such \(g\) exists because
\(\varphi\) is surjective. Then \(\varphi(gxg^{-1}) = g'\varphi(x)g'^{-1}\).
But \(gxg^{-1} \in C\). Therefore \(\varphi\) maps \(C\) surjectively to
\(C'\).</p>
<p>We are also asked to show that \(|C'|\) divides \(|C|\). I will assume that
\(G\) is finite. (I am not entirely sure whether the claim is even true in the
case where \(G\) is infinite but \(C\) is finite.) Then
\begin{align*}
\frac{|C|}{|C'|}
&amp;= \frac{|G|/|Z(x)|}{|G'|/|Z(\varphi(x))|} \\
&amp;= \frac{|G|/|G'|}{|Z(x)|/|\varphi(Z(x))|}
\frac{|Z(\varphi(x))|}{|\varphi(Z(x))|} \\
&amp;= \frac{|\ker \varphi|}{|Z(x) \cap \ker \varphi|}
\frac{|Z(\varphi(x))|}{|\varphi(Z(x))|}
\end{align*}
Now \(Z(x) \cap \ker \varphi\) is a subgroup of \(\ker\varphi\) so the first
factor in this product is an integer; and \(\varphi(Z(x))\) is a subgroup of
\(Z(\varphi(x))\) so the second factor in the product is an integer. Therefore
\(|C|/|C'|\) is an integer.</p>

<li>\(p \neq q\) and there is a conjugacy class of size \(q\) in \(G\). Let

<li>\(p \neq q\), there is no conjugacy class of size \(q\) in \(G\), and
\(G\) is nonabelian. The class equation consists of \(1\)'s and \(p\)'s. The
number of \(1\)'s in the class equation must then be a multiple of \(p\), so
\(|Z(G)|\) can only be \(p\). Then, each generator of \(Z(G)\) has order
\(p\).</li>
<li>\(p \neq q\) and \(G\) is abelian. Pick \(x \in G \setminus \{1\}\). If

\(pq\) then we're done. Otherwise \(y\) has prime order. Let \(K = \langle
y \rangle\). By Proposition 2.11.4(c), \(HK\) is a subgroup of \(G\), which
itself contains both \(H\) and \(K\) as proper subgroups; by Lagrange's
theorem, the only possible order of \(HK\) is \(pq\), so \(G = HK\). Also,
\(H \cap K\) is a subgroup of both \(H\) and \(K\) so its
order can only be 1 (or \(q\) in the case where \(|K| = q\), but that's
not possible since \(H \neq K\)). By Proposition 2.11.4(d), \(G\) is isomorphic
to \(H \times K\). Therefore \(y\) has order \(p\).</li>
