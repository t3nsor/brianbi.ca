<h2>Section 11.3. Homomorphisms and Ideals</h2>
<p><span class="problem">Exercise 11.3.1</span> Let \(I\) be an ideal of \(R\).
By definition, \(I\) is closed under addition. Also, either \(0 \in I\) or
\(I\) contains some nonzero element \(x\), whence \(0x = 0\) is in \(I\), so
either way, \(0 \in I\); \(I\) contains the identity of \(R^+\). Finally, let
\(x \in I\). Then \((-1)x \in I\), which is the inverse of \(x\) in \(R^+\).
Therefore \(I\) is a subgroup of \(R^+\).</p>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 11.3.2</span> Let \(I\) be a nonzero ideal
of \(\mathbb{Z}[i]\) and let \(a + bi \in I\) be nonzero. Then
\(a^2 + b^2 = (a - bi)(a + bi) \in I\), which is nonzero.</p>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 11.3.3</span></p>
<ol class="subproblems">
<li>This map sends all polynomials to their constant terms. It is therefore the
set of polynomials with zero constant term. It is easy to see that this ideal
is generated by \(x\) and \(y\).</li>
<li>Let \(I\) denote the ideal so defined. \(I\) is the set of
real polynomials that have \(2 + i\) as
a zero. Since \(\mathbb{R}\) is a field, Proposition 11.3.22 applies, and
\(I\) is generated by the monic polynomial of lowest degree that it
contains. Clearly \(I\) doesn't contain any linear polynomials, but it does
contain the quadratic polynomial \((x - (2 + i))(x - (2 - i)) =
x^2 - 4x + 5\). Therefore \(x^2 - 4x + 5\) generates \(I\).</li>
<li><p>Denote the given ideal by \(I\). \(I\) is the set of all integer
polynomials that have \(1 + \sqrt{2}\) as a zero. Let \(I_{\mathbb{Q}}\) be the
ideal of <em>rational</em> polynomials that have \(1 + \sqrt{2}\) as a zero.
Evidently, \(I \subseteq I_{\mathbb{Q}}\). By Proposition 11.3.22,
\(I_{\mathbb{Q}}\) is generated by the monic polynomial of lowest
degree that it contains. Clearly \(I_{\mathbb{Q}}\) doesn't contain any linear
polynomials, but it does contain the quadratic polynomial
\((x - (1 + \sqrt{2}))(x - (1 - \sqrt{2})) = x^2 - 2x - 1\). Therefore every
element \(f \in I_{\mathbb{Q}}\) can be written as \(f = (x^2 - 2x - 1)g\)
where \(g \in \mathbb{Q}[x]\).</p>
<p>Let \(I'\) denote the ideal of \(\mathbb{Z}[x]\) generated by
\(x^2 - 2x - 1\). Clearly \(I' \subseteq I\).</p>
<p>Suppose \(f \in I\). Then
\(f \in I_{\mathbb{Q}}\), so we can write \(f = (x^2 - 2x - 1)g\), that is,
\(x^2 - 2x - 1\) divides \(f\) in \(\mathbb{Q}[x]\). Since \(f\) has integer
coefficients and \(x^2 - 2x - 1\) is monic, Lemma 11.3.24 applies, and
\(x^2 - 2x - 1\) divides \(f\) in \(\mathbb{Z}[x]\), that is, \(g \in
\mathbb{Z}[x]\). This establishes that \(f \in I'\). Since this holds for all
\(f \in I\), we see that \(I \subseteq I'\).</p>
<p>We conclude that \(I = I'\), that is, \(I\) is generated by
\(x^2 - 2x - 1\).</p></li>
<li><p>By Proposition 11.3.10, this homomorphism must send the constant
polynomials to themselves. Proposition 11.3.4 then applies, and the map in
question is the map that
sends the polynomial \(f\) to the value \(f(\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3})\). Thus, if we
can find the monic polynomial \(P \in \mathbb{Q}[x]\) of minimum degree that
has \(\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}\) as a zero, and \(P\) turns out to have integer
coefficients, then \(P\) generates the ideal in question, by the reasoning
applied in part (c).</p>
<p>In order to find \(P\), we first observe that \(\mathbb{Q}[\sqrt{2},
\sqrt{3}]\) has the following endomorphisms:</p>
<ul>
<li>\(\varphi_2(a + b\sqrt{2} + c\sqrt{3} + d\sqrt{6}) =
a - b\sqrt{2} + c\sqrt{3} - d\sqrt{6}\)</li>
<li>\(\varphi_3(a + b\sqrt{2} + c\sqrt{3} + d\sqrt{6}) =
a + b\sqrt{2} - c\sqrt{3} - d\sqrt{6}\)</li>
<li>\(\varphi_{23}(a + b\sqrt{2} + c\sqrt{3} + d\sqrt{6}) =
a - b\sqrt{2} - c\sqrt{3} + d\sqrt{6}\)</li>
</ul>
<p>If \(\varphi\) is an endomorphism of a ring \(R\), it is easy to see that
for all \(f \in R[x], x \in R\), we have \(\varphi(f(x)) =
\varphi(f)(\varphi(x))\), where \(\varphi(f)\) is defined as the polynomial
obtained by replacing each coefficient \(c_i\) of \(f\) by
\(\varphi(c_i)\).</p>
<p>Suppose \(f \in \mathbb{Q}[x]\) and \(f(\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}) = 0\). If we
regard \(f\) as an element of \(\mathbb{Q}[\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}][x]\), then
\(0 = \varphi_2(f(\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3})) = \varphi_2(f)(\varphi_2(\sqrt{2} +
\sqrt{3})) = f(-\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3})\). Similar logic using \(\varphi_3\)
and \(\varphi_{23}\) shows that \(f(\sqrt{2} - \sqrt{3}) =
f(-\sqrt{2} -\sqrt{3}) = 0\). Therefore \(P\) must have degree at least 4.
In fact, the product of the four monomials \(x - (\pm \sqrt{2} \pm \sqrt{3})\)
is \(x^4 - 10x^2 + 1\), which is monic and has integer coefficients; therefore
this is the polynomial we are looking for. We conclude that the ideal is
generated by \(x^4 - 10x^2 + 1\).</p></li>
<li><p>Although this isn't explicitly stated, it seems we're supposed to
assume that the map in question sends the constant polynomials to themselves,
so that we can apply Proposition 11.3.4 as in part (d). Let \(I\) be the ideal
in question, and let \(I'\) be the ideal of
\(\mathbb{C}[x, y, z]\) generated by \(y - x^2\) and \(z - x^3\). It is easy to
see that \(I' \subseteq I\).</p>
<p>Suppose \(f \in I\). We can do division in the variable \(z\) to write
\(f(x, y, z) = (z - x^3)g(x, y, z) + h(x, y, z)\) where the remainder \(h\)
must
have degree 0 in \(z\), that is, it is a polynomial of \(x\) and \(y\) only.
We can then do division in the variable \(y\) to write \(h(x, y) =
(y - x^2)i(x, y) + j(x, y)\) where \(j\) must have degree 0 in \(y\), that is,
it is a polynomial in \(x\) only. So \(f(x, y, z) = (z - x^3)g(x, y, z) +
(y - x^2)i(x, y) + j(x)\). Evidently \(f(t, t^2, t^3) = (t^3 - t^3)g +
(t^2 - t^2)i + j(t)\), and since \(f = 0\), it follows that \(j = 0\).
Therefore \(f = (z - x^3)g + (y - x^2)i\) for some \(g \in
\mathbb{C}[x, y, z], h \in \mathbb{C}[x, y]\). Therefore \(f \in I'\). Since
this holds for all \(f \in I\), we have \(I \subseteq I'\)</p>
<p>Since \(I' \subseteq I\) and \(I \subseteq I'\), we conclude \(I = I'\),
so \(I\) is generated by \(z - x^3\) and \(y - x^2\).</p></li>
</ol>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 11.3.4</span> Again, although this isn't
explicitly stated, I assume the intended map is the one that sends the
constant polynomials to themselves, so that Proposition 11.3.4 applies, and
the map in question is unique and given by substitution. Let \(P(x, y)
= y - (x - 1)^3 + 1\).
Then \(\varphi(P) = t^3 - 1 - ((t + 1) - 1)^3 + 1 = 0\). Let \(I = (P)\). It is
clear that \(I \subseteq \ker K\). On the other hand, let \(f \in \ker K\).
Using polynomial division in \(y\), write \(f(x, y) = P(x, y) g(x, y) +
r(x, y)\). Since \(P\) has degree 1 in \(y\), the remainder \(r\) must have
degree 0 in \(y\), that is, \(r\) is a polynomial in \(x\) alone. Then
\(0 = \varphi(f) = \varphi(P)\varphi(g) + r(t + 1) = r(t + 1)\), so the
polynomial \(r(t + 1)\) is identically zero. Since the field is \(\mathbb{C}\),
this implies that \(r\) is the zero polynomial. Therefore
\(f = Pg\). We conclude that \(\ker K = \{Pg \mid g \in
\mathbb{C}[x, y]\}\).</p>
<p>Let \(I'\) be an ideal that contains \(\ker K\). If \(I' = \ker K\), then as
we have established, \(I'\) is generated by the element \(P =
y - (x - 1)^3 + 1\). Suppose on the other hand that \(I'\) is strictly larger
than \(\ker K\). If \(f \in I' \setminus \ker K\), then division by \(P\)
yields \(f = Pg + r\) where \(r\) is a nonzero polynomial of \(x\) alone.
Since \(Pg \in I'\), it follows that \(r \in I'\) also. In general, if \(S\) is
the set of remainders obtained by dividing elements of \(I'\) by \(P\), then
this reasoning shows that \(S \subseteq I'\). Observe that:</p>
<ul>
<li>If \(r \in S, f \in \mathbb{C}[x]\), that is, there exists some
\(g \in \mathbb{C}[x, y]\) such that \(Pg + r \in I'\), then since
\(f\cdot(Pg + r) \in I'\), we
have \(P\cdot(fg) + fr \in I'\), which establishes \(fr \in S\).</li>
<li>If \(r_1, r_2 \in S\), that is, there exist \(g_1, g_2 \in \mathbb{C}[x,
y]\) such that \(Pg_1 + r_1, Pg_2 + r_2 \in I'\), then since
\(Pg_1 + r_1 + Pg_2 + r_2 \in I'\), we have \(P\cdot(g_1 + g_2) +
(r_1 + r_2) \in I'\), which establishes \(r_1 + r_2 \in S\).</li>
</ul>
<p>The above results imply that \(S\) is an ideal of \(\mathbb{C}[x]\). By
Proposition 11.3.22, there is some polynomial \(Q(x)\) such that
\(S = \{Qh \mid h \in \mathbb{C}[x]\}\). Obviously \(Q \in S \subseteq I'\),
so \((P, Q) \subseteq I'\). Conversely,
let \(f \in I'\); write \(f = Pg + r\), and since \(r \in S\), we can write
\(r = Qh\), so \(f = Pg + Qh\). Therefore \(I' \subseteq (P, Q)\). We conclude
that \(I' = (P, Q)\), so at most two elements are needed to generate
\(I'\).</p>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 11.3.5</span> Consider \(F[x]\) as a vector
space over \(F\). One important property that the
derivative operation is a linear endomorphism. We will not prove this here
since the proof is easy, but we will use it in what follows.</p>
<ol class="subproblems">
<li>Let \(f = x^a, g = x^b\). Then \((fg)' = (a+b)x^{a+b-1}\), and
\(f'g + fg' = ax^{a-1} x^b + x^a bx^{b-1} = (a+b)x^{a+b-1}\), therefore
\((fg)' = f'g + fg'\). Now let \(f\) and \(g\) be arbitrary elements of
\(\mathbb{C}[x]\) and let \(h(f, g) = (fg)' - f'g - fg'\). By linearity of
differentiation, it follows that \(h\) is bilinear in its two arguments. We
already established that \(h(x^a, x^b) = 0\) for all monomials \(x^a, x^b\),
so \(h\) vanishes on a basis. Therefore \(h \) vanishes identically.
<div class="qed"></div></li>
<li><p>We'll first prove the claim for a restricted class of pairs of
functions, those for which \(f\) is of the form \(f(x) = x^a\)
while \(g \in \mathbb{C}[x]\) is arbitrary. We'll proceed by induction on the
degree \(a\).</p>
<p><em>Base case:</em> \(a = 0\). Then \((f \circ g)' = (1 \circ g)' =
1' = 0\) while \((f' \circ g)g' = (0 \circ g)g' = 0\) so the two are equal.</p>
<p><em>Inductive case:</em> \(a \ge 1\). By the induction hypothesis,
\((g^{a-1})' = ((x \mapsto x^{a-1}) \circ g)' =
((x \mapsto (a-1)x^{a-2}) \circ g)g' = (a-1)g^{a-2}g'\). Then, using this 
together with the product rule:
\begin{align*}
(f \circ g)' &amp;= (g^a)' \\
&amp;= (g g^{a-1})' \\
&amp;= g' g^{a-1} + g (g^{a-1})' \\
&amp;= g^{a-1} g' + g (a-1) g^{a-2} g' \\
&amp;= a g^{a-1} g' \\
&amp;= ((x \mapsto ax^{a-1}) \circ g) g' \\
&amp;= (f' \circ g) g'
\end{align*}
as required.</p>
<p>Now suppose \(f, g \in \mathbb{C}[x]\) are arbitrary. Define \(h(f, g) =
(f \circ g)' - (f' \circ g)g'\). We have already established that \(h\)
vanishes whenever \(f\) is of the form \(x^a\). Also, \(h\) is linear in its
first argument. Since \(\{x^a \mid a \in \mathbb{N}\}\) is a basis for
\(\mathbb{C}[x]\), it follows that \(h\) vanishes identically.</p>
<div class="qed"></div></li>
</ol>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 11.3.6</span> Again, although it isn't
explicitly stated, I assume the map in question is intended to send the
constant polynomials to themselves, so that it acts by substitution. That is,
for a given \(f\), we are dealing with the unique endomorphism
\(\varphi_f\) that is the ideneity on \(R\) and that sends \(x\) to 
\(x + f(y)\) and \(y\) to \(y\). We simply
need to show that the map \(\varphi_f\) is bijective.</p>
<p>We first show that \(\varphi_f\) is injective. Suppose
\(\varphi_f(g_1) = \varphi_f(g_2)\). Since the map \(\varphi_f\) is a ring
endomorphism, we have \(\varphi_f(g_1 - g_2) = 0\).  Denote \(g_1 - g_2\) by
\(h\). Suppose \(h = \sum_{i=0}^m \sum_{j=0}^n c_{ij} x^i y^j =
\sum_{i=0}^m x^i P_i(y)\), where we have defined \(P_i(y) =
\sum_{j=0}^n c_{ij} y^j\). Then
\[
0 = \varphi_f(h) = \sum_{i=0}^m (x + f(y))^i P_i(y)
\]
If we group terms in the RHS by
powers of \(x\), we see that the coefficient of the \(x^m\) term is
\(P_m(y)\). Therefore \(P_m(y) = 0\), implying \(c_{mj} = 0\) for all \(j\),
so that \(0 = \sum_{i=0}^{m-1} (x + f(y))^i P_i(y)\). Repeating this for
\(m-1, m-2, \ldots\), we find that all \(P_i\)'s vanish, so
\(h\) vanishes. Therefore \(g_1 = g_2\). This completes the proof that
\(\varphi_f\) is injective.</p>
<p>We now show that \(\varphi_f\) is surjective. Let \(g(x, y)\) be given
and let \(h(x, y) = g(x - f(y), y)\). Then \(\varphi_f(h) =
h(x + f(y), y) = g((x + f(y)) - f(y), y) = g(x, y)\).</p>
<p>We have shown that \(\varphi_f\) is both surjective and injective, so we
are done.</p>
<div class="qed"></div>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 11.3.7</span> By Proposition 11.3.10, any
endomorphism of \(\mathbb{Z}[x]\) must send the constant polynomials to
themselves. By the subtitution principle, for each \(f \in \mathbb{Z}[x]\),
there is a unique endomorphism \(\varphi_f\) on \(\mathbb{Z}[x]\) that sends
the constant polynomials to themselves and that sends \(x\) to \(f(x)\), which
is given by substituting \(f(x)\) for \(x\); that is, \(\varphi_f(g)
= g \circ f\). It is clear that all endomorphisms of \(\mathbb{Z}[x]\) are of
this form, since each
endomorphism must send \(x\) to some polynomial. So we need to determine
which \(\varphi_f\) are bijective.</p>
<p>We can rule out all constant \(f\), since the image of \(\varphi_f\) would
contain only constants.</p>
<p>In general, for nonzero \(f, g\) the degree of \(g \circ f\) is the product
of the degrees of \(f\) and \(g\). Therefore if \(f\) has degree 2 or greater,
the image of \(\varphi_f\) doesn't contain any linear polynomials. So we can
rule out all such \(f\) as well.</p>
<p>If \(f\) is linear, \(f = ax + b\), then the leading coefficient of
\(g \circ f\) will always be a multiple of \(a\). So \(\varphi_f\) will not be
surjective unless \(a\) is a unit. Thus, if \(\varphi_f\) is to be an
automorphism, we must have \(a = \pm 1\).</p>
<p>Suppose \(f\) is indeed
of this form. If \(h \in \mathbb{Z}[x]\) is given, then let \(g(x) =
h(x/a - b/a)\). Then \(g \in \mathbb{Z}\) and \(\varphi_f(g) =
g(ax + b) = h((ax + b)/a - b/a) = h(x)\). This establishes that \(\varphi_f\)
is surjective.</p>
<p>Suppose \(g, h \in \mathbb{Z}\) such that \(\varphi_f(g) = \varphi_f(h)\).
Then \(\varphi_f(g - h) = 0\). Let \(i = g - h\). Then we have that
\(i(ax + b) = 0\). If we consider \(i\) as a polynomial over \(\mathbb{R}\),
then since \(i(ax + b) = 0\) for all \(x \in \mathbb{Z}\), either \(i\) is
identically zero or else \(i\) has infinitely many zeroes, namely
\((n-b)/a\) for each integer \(n\). The latter is impossible, so \(i = 0\).
Therefore \(g = h\), that is, \(\varphi_f\) is injective. This completes the
proof that \(\varphi_f\) is bijective whenever \(f(x) = \pm x + b\).<p>
<p>Thus, the endomorphisms of \(\mathbb{Z}[x]\) are given by
\(g \mapsto g \circ f\) where \(f = \pm x + b\) for some
\(b \in \mathbb{Z}\).</p>
