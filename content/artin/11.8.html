<h2>Section 11.8. Maximal Ideals</h2>
<p><span class="problem">Exercise 11.8.1</span> No principal ideal of
\(\Z[x]\) is maximal:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ideals \((-1), (1)\) are not proper, and therefore, are not
maximal.</li>
<li>The ideals \((n)\), where \(n\) is an integer other than \(\pm 1\), are not
maximal since \((n)\) is contained in the larger ideal \((n, x)\), which is
still proper.</li>
<li>Suppose \(P \in \Z[x]\) is not a constant. There exists some \(n \in \Z\)
such that \(P(n) \notin \{-1, 0, 1\}\). Consider the ideal \(I = (P, P(n))\),
which is strictly larger than \((P)\). If \(Q \in I\), then
\(P(n) \divides Q(n)\), so \(1 \notin I\), so \(I\) is still a proper ideal.
Therefore \((P)\) isn't maximal.</li>
</ul>

<ol class="subproblems">
<li><p>Let \(I_1 = \R \times \{0\}\). It is clear that \(I_1\) is an ideal. If
\(I_1\) is contained in a larger ideal \(I\), then \((a, b) \in I\) for some
\(b \ne 0\), so \((b, b) = (b - a, 0) + (a, b) \in I\), so \((1, 1) =
(b^{-1}, b^{-1})(b, b) \in I\), therefore \(I = \R \times \R\). Therefore, we
conclude that \(I_1\) is a maximal ideal. Analogously, \(I_2 = \{0\} \times
\R\) is a maximal ideal.</p>
<p>Conversely, let \(I\) be a maximal ideal. \(I\) can't be the zero ideal,
since the zero ideal is contained in \(I_1\) and \(I_2\). So \(I\) contains
some element
\((a, b)\) where either \(a\) or \(b\) is nonzero, but not both (if it were
both, then \((1, 1) = (a^{-1}, b^{-1})(a, b) \in I\), a contradiction). If
\(a \ne 0\) and \(b = 0\), then \(I\) contains \(I_1\), so \(I = I_1\). If
\(a = 0\) and \(b \ne 0\), then \(I\) contains \(I_2\), so \(I = I_2\). We
conclude that \(I_1\) and \(I_2\) are the only maximal ideals of \(\R \times
\R\).</p></li>
<li><p>Let \(R = \R[x]/(x^2)\). Use \(\alpha\) to denote the residue of \(x\)
in \(R\). Suppose \(I \subseteq R\) is a maximal ideal. Let \(\pi : R \to R/I\)
be the canonical projection. Since \(R/I\) is a field, and
\(\pi(\alpha)\pi(\alpha) = \pi(\alpha^2) = \pi(0) = 0\), it must be that
\(\pi(\alpha) = 0\), that is, \(\alpha \in I\).</p>
<p>Obviously \(I\) can't contain any nonzero constant without being the entire
ring. If \(I\) is not just \((\alpha)\), then \(I\) must contain an element of
the form \(a\alpha + b\) where \(a, b\) are both nonzero. In that case \(b =
(a\alpha + b) - a\alpha \in I\), so again \(I = R\). We conclude that
\((\alpha)\) is the sole maximal ideal of \(R\). (It is obvious enough that
\((\alpha)\) is not the entire ring, but we can also check by taking
\(R/(\alpha)\), which is isomorphic to \(\R\), which is a field.)</p></li>
<li>Let \(R = \R[x]/(x^2 - 3x + 2)\). Let \(\alpha\) denote the residue of
\(x\) in \(R\). Since \(x^2 - 3x + 2\) factors as \((x - 1)(x - 2)\), it
follows that \((\alpha - 1)(\alpha - 2) = 0\). If \(I\) is a maximal ideal of
\(R\), then \(R/I\) is a field, so at least one of \(\alpha - 1\) or
\(\alpha - 2\) has to lie in \(I\). Obviously it can't be both, because then
\(1 \in I\), a contradiction. Now \(R/(\alpha - 1) \cong
\R[x]/(x - 1, x^2 - 3x + 2) = \R[x]/(x - 1) \cong \R\), a field, so
\((\alpha - 1)\) is a maximal ideal already. Likewise \((\alpha - 2)\) is a
maximal ideal. So \((\alpha - 1)\) and \((\alpha - 2)\) are the maximal ideals
of \(R\).</li>
<li>The polynomial \(x^2 + x + 1\) is irreducible over \(\R\), so
\((x^2 + x + 1)\) is already a maximal ideal of \(\R[x]\); so the quotient ring
\(\R[x]/(x^2 + x + 1)\) is in fact a field, and its only maximal ideal is the
zero ideal.</li>
</ol>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 11.8.3</span> If \(x^3 + x + 1\) splits over
\(\mathbb{F}_2\), then it has to have at least one linear factor. But for
all \(x \in Z\), \(x^3\) and \(x\) have the same parity, so \(x^3 + x + 1\) is
odd; therefore \(x^3 + x + 1 = 0\) has no solutions over \(\mathbb{F}_2\). We
conclude that \(x^3 + x + 1\) is irreducible over \(\mathbb{F}_2\). By
Proposition 11.8.4(a), \((x^3 + x + 1)\) is a maximal ideal of
\(\mathbb{F}_2[x]\), so \(\mathbb{F}_2[x]/(x^3 + x + 1)\) is a field.</p>
<p>Over \(\mathbb{F}_3\), the polynomial \(x^3 + x + 1\) has the divisor
\(x - 1\) since \(x^3 + x + 1 = 0\) when \(x = 1\). By Proposition 11.8.4(a),
\((x^3 + x + 1)\) is not a maximal ideal in \(\mathbb{F}_3[x]\). Therefore
\(\mathbb{F}_3[x]/(x^3 + x + 1)\) is not a field.</p>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 11.8.4</span> By Proposition 11.8.4(a), the
maximal ideals of \(\R[x]\) are the principal ideals generated by the monic
irreducible polynomials. It is well-known that the only irreducibles in
\(\R[x]\) are the linear polynomials and the quadratic polynomials with
negative discriminant. So the maximal ideals of \(\R[x]\) are the principal
ideals generated by polynomials of the form \(x + a\) and \(x^2 + bx + c\)
where \(b^2 &lt; 4c\). It is clear that two different polynomials from this set
generate different ideals. So we want to find a bijection between these
polynomials and the upper half-plane. In principle it's easy to show that one
exists since these two sets both have the cardinality of the continuum, but it
is also easy to exhibit the bijection explicitly. Define
\begin{align*}
f(x + a) &amp;= (a, 0) \\
f(x^2 + bx + c) &amp;= (b, 4c - b^2) \\
\end{align*}
The following facts imply that \(f\) is a bijection from the monic irreducible
polynomials in \(\R[x]\) to the upper half-plane (including the x-axis):</p>
<ul>
<li>By construction, the image of \(f\) is contained in the upper
half-plane.</li>
<li>Each quadratic polynomial maps to a point above the x-axis, while every
linear polynomial maps onto the x-axis. Two different linear polynomials
obviously map to different points. It isn't hard to see that this is also the
case for two different quadratic polynomials. So \(f\) is one-to-one.</li>
<li>Let \((p, q) \in \R^2\) be given, with \(q \ge 0\). If \(q = 0\), then
\((p, q) = f(x + p)\). If \(q &gt; 0\), then \((p, q) =
f(x^2 + px + (q + p^2)/4)\) and it's easy to verify that this quadratic is
irreducible. So \(f\) is onto.</li>
</ul>
