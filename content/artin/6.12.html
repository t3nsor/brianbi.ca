<h2>Section 6.12. Finite Subgroups of the Rotation Group</h2>
<p><span class="problem">Exercise 6.12.1</span> To every dodecahedron there
corresponds an inscribed icosahedron whose vertices are located at the
centres of the dodecahedron's faces. Every symmetry of the dodecahedron is
therefore a symmetry of this inscribed icosahedron. The converse is also true:
to every icosahedron we can associate a dodecahedron whose vertices are
located at the centres of the icosahedron's faces, implying that every
symmetry of the icosahedron is a symmetry of the inscribed dodecahedron also.
This implies that the symmetry groups of the dodecahedron and icosahedron are
the same.</p>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 6.12.2</span> The poles fall into three
subsets: the vertex poles \(P_v\) which are unit vectors directed from the
centre of the octahedron to one of the vertices; the edge poles \(P_e\) which
are directed from the centre to the midpoint of one of the edges; and the
face poles \(P_f\) which are directed from the centre to the centre of one of
the faces. Any symmetry of the octahedron can only map a pole to
another pole of the same type, by virtue of the fact that it maps vertices to
vertices, edges to edges, and faces to faces. But \(O\) acts transitively on
the vertices, on the edges, and on the faces of the octahedron, so there is
only a single orbit for each of \(P_v\), \(P_e\), and \(P_f\).</p> 

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 6.12.3</span> The order of \(O\) is 24, and
\(O\) acts transitively on \(S\) which has size 4, since to carry one body
diagonal onto another it suffices to carry one of the vertices of the source
diagonal onto one of the vertices of the target diagonal. Therefore the
stabilizer \(O_D\) of a single diagonal \(D\) has order \(|O|/|S| = 6\).
The 6 elements of \(O\) that fix \(D\)
are the three rotations \(\rho_0 = 1, \rho_{2\pi/3}, \rho_{4\pi/3}\)
around \(D\) and the three rotations \(\rho_0 r, \rho_{2\pi/3}r,
\rho_{4\pi/3}\) where \(r\) is some rotation that exchanges the two vertices of
\(D\); it is easy to see that these are 6 distinct elements of \(O\). There is
an isomorphism from \(O_D\) to
\(\operatorname{Perm}(S \setminus \{D\})\) mapping a rotation to the
permutation it induces on the other three body diagonals: the rotations by
120 and 240 degrees act as 3-cycles while \(r\) acts as a transposition so
that the \(\rho r\)'s correspond to odd permutations of \(S \setminus \{D\}\).
Therefore \(O_D\) is isomorphic to \(S_3\).</p>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 6.12.4</span> The group \(O\) has order 24,
and acts transitively on the set \(S = \{t_1, t_2\}\) of the two inscribed
tetrahedra (for example, any of the 90 degree rotations in \(O\) will exchange
the two tetrahedra). Therefore the stabilizer \(H = O_{t_1}\) has order 12. Now
consider the rotational symmetries of \(t_1\), which may or may not be
symmetries of the containing cube. There are 12 such symmetries (the order
of \(T\)). In fact, any permutation of the four vertices \(A, B, C, D\) of
\(t_1\) must also permute the four affine combinations
\(A + B + C - 2D, B + C + D - 2A, C + D + A - 2B, D + A + B - 2C\), but these
are precisely the other four vertices of the cube. So \(T\) is a subgroup of
\(H\). And \(H\) has the same order as \(T\), so \(H = T\).</p>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 6.12.5</span> The icosahedral group has
order 60 (Example 6.9.5(a)) and acts transitively on the set of 6 long
diagonals of the icosahedron (diagonals that join a vertex to the opposite
vertex). To see this, observe that to carry one diagonal onto another it
suffices to carry a vertex of the source diagonal onto a vertex of the target
diagonal. Therefore the stabilizer subgroup of one of these six diagonals
has order \(60 \div 6 = 10\).</p>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 6.12.6</span><p>
<ol class="subproblems">
<li><p>Every subgroup of the tetrahedral group is a finite subgroup of
\(SO(3)\). By the classification theorem (6.12.1), such a group must be cyclic,
dihedral, or one of the groups \(T, O, I\).  Obviously \(T\) is a subgroup of
\(T\) while \(O\) and \(I\) are not.</p>
<p>All elements of \(T\) have order 2 or
3, which rules out any cyclic groups of order 4 or greater. (A 180 degree
rotation that fixes an edge has order 2, while a 120 degree rotation that fixes
a vertex and the opposite face has order 3.) The elements of orders 2 and 3
generate subgroups of \(T\) isomorphic to \(C_2\) and \(C_3\).</p>
<p>Again, any \(D_n\) with \(n &gt; 3\) is ruled out since \(T\) has no
elements of order greater than 3.
The group \(D_1\) is just \(C_2\). Now consider the set
consisting of the 3 pairs of opposite edges of the tetrahedron; \(T\) acts
transitively on this set, so the stabilizer of a particular pair of edges is
a subgroup of order 4. This subgroup can't be \(C_4\), so it must be \(D_2\).
To answer the question of whether \(D_3 = S_3\) occurs as a subgroup of
\(T\), we use the fact from <a href="/artin/6.9">Exercise 6.9.4</a> that \(T\)
is isomorphic to \(A_4\), and the solution to <a href="/artin/6.11">Exercise
6.11.1</a>, which implies that the only faithful actions of \(S_3\) on a set of
4 elements are those that fix
one element while permuting the other three, therefore their images contain
odd permutations and are not subgroups of \(A_4\).</p>
<p>In conclusion, all the
subgroups of \(T\) are \(C_1, C_2, C_3, D_2\), and \(T\) itself.</li>
<li><p>Again we turn to (6.12.1). Consider first the case of cyclic groups.
\(I\) has elements of orders 1, 2, 3, and 5, and no other orders, so the cyclic
groups \(C_1, C_2, C_3, C_5\) are the only cyclic subgroups of \(I\).</p>
<p>Similarly, as \(D_n\) contains elements of order \(n\),
any dihedral group other than \(D_1, D_2, D_3, D_5\)
can't be a subgroup of \(I\). Again, \(D_1\) is just \(C_2\), and again
\(D_2\) arises as the stabilizer group of a pair of opposite edges of
an icosahedron. Now \(I\) acts transitively on the set of the 10 pairs of
opposite faces of an icosahedron, so the stabilizer group \(H\) of one of these
10 pairs must have order 6. \(H\) consists  of three rotations by 0, 120, and
240 degrees, call them \(1, \rho, \rho^2\), around the axis joining the centres
of the two faces, plus the three rotations consisting of the composition of one
of these three aforementioned rotations with some fixed rotation \(r\) that
exchanges the two faces. By labelling the three vertices of one of the faces,
we can see that \(r\rho r^{-1} = \rho^{-1}\), so \(H\) is isomorphic to
\(D_3\). \(I\) also acts transitively on the set of the 6 pairs of opposite
faces of a dodecahedron, and by similar reasoning we find that a stabilizer
subgroup of order 10 that is isomorphic to \(D_5\).</p>
<p>We now turn our attention to the last three groups, \(T, O, I\). \(I\) is of
course a subgroup of itself. \(O\) contains elements of order 4, so it isn't a
subgroup of \(I\). We claim that \(T\) is a subgroup of \(I\). This argument is
due to <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/a/2463774/24692">Steven
Stadnicki</a>. Let \(t\) be one of the tetrahedra inscribed in a dodecahedron.
Now \(T\) is the symmetry
group of \(t\) and it is generated by the 120 degree rotations around an axis
passing through a vertex of \(t\) and the centre of the opposite face. But
such an axis also passes through the opposite vertex on the dodecahedron, and
the dodecahedron has 3-fold rotational symmetry around that axis. This implies
that each rotational symmetry of \(t\) is also a rotational symmetry of the
icosahedron in which \(t\) is inscribed. The 12 elements of \(T\) therefore
form a subgroup of \(I\).</p>
<p>In conclusion, all the subgroups of \(I\) are given by \(C_1, C_2, C_3,
C_5, D_2, D_3, D_5, T\), and the entire group \(I\).</p>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 6.12.7</span> Let \(P = (1, \alpha, 0).\)
If \(\alpha &gt; 1,\) then of the points \((\pm 1, \pm \alpha, 0),\) the one
closest to \(P\) other than itself is \((-1, \alpha, 0),\) which is 2 units
away. The two points \((0, -1, \pm \alpha)\) are more than 2 units away from
\(P\), as are \((-\alpha, 0, \pm 1).\) Therefore the five points adjacent to
\(P\) must be \((-1, \alpha, 0), (0, 1, \pm \alpha), (\alpha, 0, \pm 1).\)
In order for \((1, \alpha, 0)\) to be 2 units from \((0, 1, \alpha),\) we
must have \(1 + (\alpha - 1)^2 + \alpha^2 = 4,\) which has a single positive
root \(\alpha = \frac{1}{2}(1 + \sqrt{5}).\) With this choice of \(\alpha,\)
we can easily verify that the following five sets of points:
\begin{array}{ccc}
(1, \alpha, 0) &amp; (-1, \alpha, 0) &amp; (0, 1, \alpha) \\
(1, \alpha, 0) &amp; (0, 1, \alpha) &amp; (\alpha, 0, 1) \\
(1, \alpha, 0) &amp; (\alpha, 0, 1) &amp; (\alpha, 0, -1) \\
(1, \alpha, 0) &amp; (\alpha, 0, -1) &amp; (0, 1, -\alpha) \\
(1, \alpha, 0) &amp; (0, 1, -\alpha) &amp; (-1, \alpha, 0)
\end{array}
are equilateral triangles with side length 2, meeting at the vertex
\((1, \alpha, 0).\) By applying rotations and reflections to \((1, \alpha, 0)\)
we can similarly write down such a set of 5 equilateral triangles of side
length 2 meeting at any of the other 12 given points. (For example, to get
the five triangles meeting at \((-1, \alpha, 0),\) just reverse the sign of
each \(\pm 1\) entry in the table above.) Each triangle is counted 3 times, one
for each of its vertices, so there are \(12 \times 5 \div 3 = 20\) triangles
in all, which therefore form the faces of a regular icosahedron.</p>
