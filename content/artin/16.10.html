<p><span class="problem">Exercise 16.10.1</span> The degree of \(\zeta_3\) over
\(\Q\) is 2, therefore its degree over \(\Q(\zeta_7)\) is either 2 or 1.
Suppose it is 1. Then \(\zeta_3 \in \Q(\zeta_7)\), so \(\Q(\zeta_7)\) contains
the subfield \(\Q(\sqrt{-3})\). But by Theorem 16.10.12, the unique quadratic
extension of \(\Q\) contained in \(\Q(\zeta_7)\) is \(\Q(\sqrt{-7})\), so a
contradiction has been reached. Therefore \([\Q(\zeta_3, \zeta_7) :
\Q(\zeta_7)] = 2\), and
\[
[\Q(\zeta_3, \zeta_7) : \Q(\zeta_3)] =
\frac{[\Q(\zeta_3, \zeta_7) : \Q(\zeta_7)][\Q(\zeta_7) : \Q]}
{[\Q(\zeta_3) : \Q]} = 6
\]</p>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 16.10.2</span> In Example 16.10.3, the field
\(L_2\) was defined as the fixed field of \(\sigma^4\), which maps
\(\zeta\) to \(\zeta^{3^4} = \zeta^{-4}\). Let
\begin{align*}
\alpha_1 &amp;= \zeta + \zeta^{-4} + \zeta^{-1} + \zeta^4 \\
\alpha_2 &amp;= \zeta^3 + \zeta^5 + \zeta^{-3} + \zeta^{-5} \\
\alpha_3 &amp;= \zeta^{-8} + \zeta^{-2} + \zeta^8 + \zeta^2 \\
\alpha_4 &amp;= \zeta^{-7} + \zeta^2 + \zeta^{-8} + \zeta^{-2}
\end{align*}
Clearly \(\alpha_1\) is fixed by \(\sigma^4\), so \(\Q(\alpha_1) \subseteq
L_2\). In addition, the set \(\{\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3, \alpha_4\}\) is
the orbit of \(\alpha_1\) under \(\sigma\), so by Theorem 16.5.2, the minimal
polynomial for \(\alpha_1\) over \(\Q\) has degree 4, so
\([\Q(\alpha_1) : \Q] = 4\). But \(L_2\) is also a quartic extension, so
\(\alpha_1\) in fact generates \(L_2\) over \(\Q\).</p>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 16.10.3</span> By Proposition 16.10.2,
\(\Gal(\Q(\zeta)/\Q)\) is isomorphic to \(C_6\) and is generated by
\(\sigma = \zeta \mapsto \zeta^3\) since 3 is a primitive root modulo 7. By the
fundamental theorem, there are two intermediate fields, namely the fixed fields
of the \(C_2\) subgroup generated by \(\sigma^3 = \zeta \mapsto \zeta^{-1}\)
and the \(C_3\) subgroup generated by \(\sigma^2 = \zeta \mapsto \zeta^2\).
By the fundamental theorem, the former field has degree 3 over \(\Q\), so we
will call it \(L_3\). We observe that the elements \(\zeta^2 + \zeta^{-2}\)
and \(\zeta^3 + \zeta^{-3}\) belong to \(L_3\), and that since
\(\{1, \zeta, \zeta^2, \zeta^3, \zeta^{-3}, \zeta^{-2}\}\) form a \(\Q\)-basis
of \(\Q(\zeta)\), the three numbers \(1\), \(\zeta^2 + \zeta^{-2}\), and
\(\zeta^3 + \zeta^{-3}\) are linearly independent over \(\Q\) and must
therefore form a basis of \(L_3\). Similarly, \(\zeta + \zeta^2 + \zeta^{-3}\)
belongs to \(L_2\), and is linearly independent from 1, therefore it generates
\(L_2\) over \(\Q\).</p>
<p>It follows that an element of \(\Q(\zeta)\) belongs to \(L_3\) if and only
if, when written in the basis \(\{1, \zeta, \zeta^2, \zeta^3, \zeta^{-3},
\zeta^{-2}\}\), it takes the form \(p + q(\zeta^2 + \zeta^{-2}) +
r(\zeta^3 + \zeta^{-3})\), and belongs to \(L_2\) if and only if it takes the
form \(p + q(\zeta + \zeta^2 + \zeta^{-3})\) in the same basis, where \(p\)
and \(q\) are rational. These results allow us to easily determine
the degrees of the following elements of \(\Q(\zeta)\):</p>
<ol class="subproblems">
<li>This is not in either form, so the field it generates must be the full
field \(\Q(\zeta)\); the degree is 6.</li>
<li>This can be rewritten as \(\zeta^3 + \zeta^{-3}\), which satisfies the
criterion to be a member of \(L_3\). Therefore its degree is 3.</li>
<li>This can be rewritten as \(\zeta^3 + \zeta^{-2} + (-1 - \zeta - \zeta^2
- \zeta^3 - \zeta^{-3} - \zeta^{-2}) = -1 - \zeta - \zeta^2 - \zeta^{-3}\),
which satisfies the criterion to be a member of \(L_2\). Therefore its degree
is 2.</li>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 16.10.6</span></p>
<ol class="subproblems">
<li><p>We will follow the proof in the text closely. We will assume that for
every prime \(p\) there is a primitive root
\(g\) modulo \(p\). There are various proofs of this theorem, but we won't get
into them here.</p>
<p>Let \(p\) be a prime other than 2, let \(g\) be a primitive root
modulo \(p\), and let \(\sigma = \zeta \mapsto \zeta^g\); \(\sigma\)
generates the Galois group \(G\) of \(\Q(\zeta)/\Q\). Let \(H\) denote the
subgroup \(\langle \sigma^2 \rangle\). The \(G\)-orbit of \(\zeta\) splits into
two \(H\)-orbits \(O_1, O_2\), with \(\zeta \in O_1\). Let \(\alpha_1,
\alpha_2\) respectively denote the sums over the orbits \(O_1, O_2\). The set
\(\{\alpha_1, \alpha_2\}\) is a \(G\)-orbit, so by Theorem 16.5.2, the
elements \(\alpha_1, \alpha_2\) have degree 2 over the fixed field of \(G\),
which is \(\Q\), and their minimal polynomial is \((x - \alpha_1)
(x - \alpha_2)\). The linear coefficient is \(-(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2) =
-\sum_{i=1}^{p-1} \zeta^i = 1\). We wish to compute the constant coefficient,
\(\alpha_1 \alpha_2 = \prod_{x \in O_1} \prod_{y \in O_2} xy\).</p>
<p>In general, \(O_1 = \{\zeta, \sigma^2(\zeta), \sigma^4(\zeta), \ldots,
\sigma^{p-3}(\zeta)\}\) and \(O_2 = \{\sigma(\zeta), \sigma^3(\zeta), \ldots,
\sigma^{p-2}(\zeta)\}\). Let \(\tau = \sigma^{(p-1)/2}\). Then
\(\tau^2 = \sigma^{p-1}\) is the identity automorphism, but \(\tau\) is not the
identity. Therefore \(\tau\) has order 2, and must map \(\zeta\) to
\(\zeta^{-1}\).</p>
<p>If \(p = 4k + 1\), then \(\tau = \sigma^{2k}\), and \(\zeta^{-1} =
\tau(\zeta)\) occurs in \(O_1\). Therefore for each \(\zeta^j\) that occurs in
\(O_1\), \(\zeta^{-j}\) also occurs. The product \(\alpha_1 \alpha_2\) contains
\((2k) \cdot (2k) = 4k^2\) terms when fully expanded, and none of them are
equal to 1 since \(\zeta^j\) and \(\zeta^{-j}\) always occur in the same orbit.
Since \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\) is rational, each of the \(4k\) powers of \(\zeta\)
different from 1 must occur the same number of times in the product. Therefore,
each one occurs \(k\) times, and \(\alpha_1 \alpha_2 =
k \sum_{i=1}^{p-1} \zeta^i = -k\). The minimal polynomial is
\(x^2 + x - k\), and the discriminant is \(4k + 1 = p\), therefore the
quadratic intermediate field is \(\Q(\sqrt{p})\).</p>
<p>If \(p = 4k + 3\), then \(\tau = \sigma^{2k + 1}\), and \(\zeta^{-1} =
\tau(\zeta)\) occurs in \(O_2\). Therefore if \(\zeta^j\) occurs in one orbit,
then \(\zeta^{-j}\) occurs in the other, and of the \((2k + 1)^2\) terms in
the product \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\), \(2k + 1\) of them are equal to 1. In the
remaining \(2k(2k + 1)\) terms, each of the \(4k + 2\) powers of \(\zeta\)
different from 1 must occur the same number of times, that is, \(k\) times.
So \(\alpha_1 \alpha_2\) is the sum of the contribution \(2k + 1\) from the
1's in the product, and \(-k\) from the other terms, for a total of \(k + 1\).
The minimal polynomial is \(x^2 + x + (k + 1)\), and the discriminant is
\(-4k - 3 = -p\), therefore the quadratic intermediate field is
\(\Q(\sqrt{-p})\).</p>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 16.10.7</span></p>
<ol class="subproblems">
<li><p>The polynomial \(x^n - 1\) has \(n\) roots, given by \(\zeta_n^j\) for
\(j \in \{0, 1, \ldots, n-1\}\), and therefore splits completely in the field
\(\Q(\zeta_n)\). This field extension of \(\Q\) is also clearly generated by
the roots of \(x^n - 1\). Thus \(K\) is a splitting field over \(\Q\), and
equivalently a Galois extension.</p></li>
<li><p>An element of \(\Gal(K/\Q)\) is completely determined by the image of
\(\zeta_n\). Since \(\zeta_n\) is a primitive \(n\)<sup>th</sup> root of
unity, its image under a \(\Q\)-automorphism must also be a primitive
\(n\)<sup>th</sup> root of unity, that is, it must map \(\zeta_n\) to
\(\zeta_n^j\) where \(j \in U\). The composition of such automorphisms is
multiplicative in \(j\), so \(\Gal(K/\Q)\) is isomorphic to a subgroup of
\(U\).</p></li>
<li><p>For \(n = 6\), \(\Gal(K/\Q)\) contains the identity and the complex
conjugation operation, which maps \(\zeta_6\) to \(\zeta_6^{-1}\), and
\(U\) also has order 2.</p>
<p>For \(n = 8\), \(K = \Q(i, \sqrt{2})\) and there are four automorphisms
according to \(i \mapsto \pm i\) and \(\sqrt{2} \mapsto \pm \sqrt{2}\). The
order of \(U\) is also 4.</p>
<p>For \(n = 12\), \(K = \Q(i, \sqrt{3})\) and there are four automorphisms

</ol>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 16.10.8</span> The splitting field of
\(x^8 - 1\) is the field \(\Q(\zeta_8)\) discussed in 16.10.7, so its Galois
group is the group of units in \(\Z/8\Z\), which has order 4. Since
\(1 \equiv 1^2 \equiv 3^2 \equiv 5^2 \equiv 7^2 \pmod 8\), this group must be
isomorphic to the Klein four-group (and not the cyclic group of order 4).</p>
<p>Similarly, the Galois group of \(x^{12} - 1\) has order 4, and since
\(1 \equiv 1^2 \equiv 5^2 \equiv 7^2 \equiv 11^2 \pmod{12}\), the Galois group
is again isomorphic to \(V_4\).</p>
<p>By Exercise 12.4.18, the cyclotomic polynomial \(\Psi_9(x)\) is irreducible,
which implies that the Galois group of the polynomial \(x^9 - 1\) has order
at least equal to that of \(U\), and is hence again isomorphic to \(U\). In
this case, there is a primitive root 2, so the Galois group is cyclic of order
6.</p>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 16.10.9</span></p>
<ol class="subproblems">
<li><p>By the product rule, we explicitly have
\begin{equation}
f'(\alpha_i) = \prod_{j \ne i} (\alpha_i - \alpha_j)
\end{equation}
with all other terms vanishing since they contain the factor \(x - \alpha_i\)
evaluated at \(x = \alpha_i\). Consequently, \(\prod_{i=1}^n f'(\alpha_i)\)
contains a total of \(n(n-1)\) factors, where \(\alpha_i - \alpha_j\) occurs
together with \(\alpha_j - \alpha_i\) exactly once for each pair
\(1 \le i &lt; j \le n\). Their product is \(-(\alpha_i - \alpha_j)^2\). The
product of the \(n(n-1)/2\) such squares in the determinant, and there are
\(n(n-1)/2\) minus signs, so the determinant differs in sign from
\(\prod_{i=1}^n f'(\alpha_i)\) precisely when \(n(n-1)/2\) is odd, or more
precisely, when \(n\) is congruent to 2 or 3 (modulo 4).</p></li>
<li><p>The case \(p = 2\) is simple and can be dealt with separately. For the
polynomial \(x^p - 1\) with \(p\) an odd prime, the roots are the
\(p\)<sup>th</sup> roots of unity and the derivative is \(px^{p-1}\), which,
when evaluated at \(x\) a \(p\)<sup>th</sup> root of unity, becomes
\(px^{-1}\). The product of all such values is \(p^p\) since each root except 1
cancels with its reciprocal. If \(p\) is congruent to 1 modulo 4, then by part
(a), the discriminant is \(p^p\). The cyclotomic field contains the square root
of the discriminant, so it contains the quadratic subfield
\(\Q(\sqrt{p^p}) = \Q(\sqrt{p})\). If \(p\) is congruent to 3 modulo 4, then
by part (a), the discriminant is \(-p^p\), so similarly, the cyclotomic field
contains \(\Q(\sqrt{-p^p}) = \Q(\sqrt{-p})\).</li>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 16.10.10</span> Let \(\alpha_1, \ldots,
\alpha_p\) be the roots of a complex monic polynomial \(P\) of degree \(p\) and
suppose that for \(i \in \{1, \ldots, p - 1\}\), the quantities
\(\gamma_i = \sum_{j=1}^p \zeta^{(i-1)(j-1)} \alpha_j\) vanish. (Note that we
have relabelled the \(\gamma\)'s from the question text, for notational
convenience.) We will show that \(P\) is reducible.</p>
<p>Suppose \(\alpha_1  + \ldots + \alpha_p = \delta\). Then we have a system of
\(p\) linear equations in the \(p\) unknowns \(\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_p\),
which can be written
\begin{equation}
\gamma_i = \sum_{j=1}^p M_{ij} \alpha_j
\end{equation}
where \(M_{ij} = \zeta^{(i-1)(j-1)}\), \(\gamma_2 = \ldots = \gamma_p = 0\),
and \(\gamma_1 = \delta\). It can be shown that \(M^{-1} = \frac{1}{p}M^*\), so
\begin{equation}
\alpha_i = \frac{1}{p} \sum_{j=1}^p \zeta^{-(i-1)(j-1)} \gamma_j
\end{equation}
Since only \(\gamma_1\) is nonzero, this reduces to \(\alpha_i = \delta/p\) for
each \(i\). This implies that \(P(x) = (x - \delta/p)^p\), and \(P\) is not
irreducible.</p>
