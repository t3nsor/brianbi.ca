<ol class="subproblems">
<li>Observe that \(\cos 72^\circ = \cos 288^\circ =
2\cos^2 144^\circ - 1 = 2(2 \cos^2 72^\circ - 1)^2 - 1\). So, if we put
\(x = \cos 72^\circ\) then we have \(x = 2(2x^2 - 1)^2 - 1\) which can be
expanded to yield a quartic equation for \(x\). However, two of the roots
\(x_1, x_2\) of this quartic are obviously just the roots of \(x = 2x^2 - 1\),
which lie in a quadratic extension \(\Q(\sqrt{d})\) of the rationals. Dividing
out \((x - x_1)(x - x_2)\) from the quartic yields a quadratic polynomial with
coefficients in \(\Q(\sqrt{d})\), so the remaining two roots lie in some
quadratic extension of this field. One of these four roots is
\(\cos 72^\circ\), so by Theorem 15.5.6, the latter is constructible. This
implies that the regular pentagon is constructible.</li>
<li>It is possible to devise the construction by writing out the explicit form
of \(\cos 72^\circ\), which is \(\frac{\sqrt{5} - 1}{4}\), and applying
Lemma 15.5.11, constructing first 5, then \(\sqrt{5}\), then
\(\sqrt{5} - 1\), and finally \((\sqrt{5} - 1)/4\). More elegant constructions
are given
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagon#Construction_of_a_regular_pentagon">here</a>.</li>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 15.5.3</span> The regular nonagon is not
constructible. To see this, use the same argument used to show that the
regular heptagon is not constructibe. Namely, let \(\zeta = e^{2\pi i/9}\) and
note that the minimal polynomial of \(\zeta\) is \(x^6 + x^3 + 1\) (Exercise
12.4.18). If the regular nonagon were constructible, then \(\cos 2\pi/9\) and
\(\sin 2\pi/9\) would be constructible and would lie in a field extension \(K\)
of the rationals with degree \(2^k\), and \(\zeta = \cos 2\pi/9 +
i\sin 2\pi/9\) would lie in \(K(i)\), which has degree \(2^{k+1}\), but this
contradicts the fact that the degree of \(\zeta\) is 6.</p>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 15.5.4</span> Yes. If the side length of the
triangle is \(s\), then its area is \(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}s^2\) so the square
with the same area would have side length \(\frac{\sqrt[4]{3}}{2}s\). The
number \(\frac{\sqrt[4]{3}}{2}\) is constructible, and we are given \(s\), so
\(\frac{\sqrt[4]{3}}{2}s\) is constructible.</p>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 15.5.5</span> I skipped this problem because
I have no idea what it's asking.</p>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 15.5.6</span> Say that a complex
number \(z\) is \(\C\)-constructible if \(z \in K\) where \(K\) is a
subfield of \(\C\) and there is a sequence of quadratic field extensions
\(\Q = F_0 \subseteq F_1 \subseteq \ldots \subseteq F_n = K\). (We use this
term to avoid confusion with the concept of real constructibility as defined on
page 453.) We claim that a point \((x, y)\) is constructible iff the complex
number \(z = x + yi\) is \(\C\)-constructible. We will make use of a simple
lemma:<p>
<p class="lemma">Suppose
\begin{gather*}
\Q = F_0 \subseteq F_1 \subseteq \ldots \subseteq F_m \subseteq \\
\Q = K_0 \subseteq K_1 \subseteq \ldots \subseteq K_n \subseteq
\end{gather*}
where each field extension \(F_j/F_{j-1}\) and \(K_j/K_{j-1}\) has degree 2.
Then there is a tower of fields
\begin{gather*}
\Q = L_0 \subseteq L_1 \subseteq \ldots \subseteq L_p
\end{gather*}
where each extension \(L_j/L_{j-1}\) is quadratic and \(L_p\) contains both
\(F_m\) and \(K_n\) as subfields.</p>
<p class="proof">Let \(L_j = F_j\) for \(j = 0, 1, \ldots, m\).
Since each extension \(K_j/K_{j-1}\) is quadratic, it is
generated by a single element \(\alpha_i\), and \(K_j =
\Q(\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_j)\). Let \(L_{m+j} =
L_m(\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_j)\) for \(j = 1, \ldots, n\). Then
\(F_{j-1} = \Q(\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_{j-1}) \subseteq
F_m(\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_{j-1}) = L_{m+j-1}\). The degree of \(\alpha_j\)
over \(L_{m+j-1}\) is then at most its degree over \(F_{j-1}\), so it is at
most 2. Also, \(L_{m+n} = F_m(\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n)\), so it contains
both \(F_m\) as a subfield and \(\Q(\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n) = K_n\). The
tower of fields
\begin{equation*}
\Q = L_0 \subseteq L_1 \subseteq \ldots \subseteq L_{m+n} \subseteq \C
\end{equation*}
then satisfies the desired criteria, after links with degree 1 are removed from
the chain.</p>
<p>We now show that if the point \((x, y)\) is constructible, then
\(x + yi\) is \(\C\)-constructible. Since \((x, y)\) is constructible, both of
its coordinates are constructible. We can write \(x \in F_m, y \in K_n\) with
\begin{gather*}
\Q = F_0 \subseteq F_1 \subseteq \ldots \subseteq F_m \subseteq \R \\
\Q = K_0 \subseteq K_1 \subseteq \ldots \subseteq K_n \subseteq \R
\end{gather*}
where \([F_j : F_{j-1}] = 2\) for each \(j = 1, \ldots, m\) and
\([K_j : K_{j-1}] = 2\) for each \(j = 1, \ldots, n\). Applying the Lemma, we
construct a field \(L_p\) generated by successive quadratic extensions of
\(\Q\) that contains both \(x\) and \(y\). The field \(L_p(i)\) is then a field
generated by successive quadratic extensions of \(\Q\) that contains
\(x + yi\). Therefore \(x + yi\) is \(C\)-constructible.</p>
<p>Now, suppose \(z = x + yi \in K\) where
\(\Q = F_0 \subseteq F_1 \subseteq \ldots \subseteq F_n = K \subseteq \C\)
and \([F_i : F_{i-1}] = 2\) for each \(i = 1, \ldots, n\). We will prove by
induction that \((x, y)\) is constructible. The base case is \(n = 0\); here
\(z\) is rational and the point \((x, y)\) is just the point \((z, 0)\), so it
is constructible. Now, for the inductive case, assume \(n\) is the smallest
possible for the given \(z\), so that \(z \notin F_{n-1}\). Since \([F_n :
F_{n-1}] = 2\), there exist \(a, b \in F_{n-1}\) with \(z^2 + az + b = 0\).
By the induction hypothesis, the points \((\Re(a), \Im(a))\) and
\((\Re(b), \Im(b))\) are constructible, so the real numbers
\(\Re(a), \Re(b), \Im(a), \Im(b)\) are constructible. Successive applications
of the Lemma imply that these four real numbers belong to a common field
\(L\) which is generated by successive quadratic extensions from \(\Q\) and
\(L\) can be chosen so that \(L \subseteq \R\). Using the
<a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/a/44414">explicit
formula</a> for the square roots of a complex number in
terms of its real and imaginary parts, we can solve the quadratic
\(z^2 + az + b = 0\) for \(x\) and \(y\) in terms of the real and imaginary
parts of \(a\) and \(b\) using the four basic operations and square roots.
This implies that \(x\) and \(y\) are
constructible real numbers, so \((x, y)\) is constructible.</p>
<div class="qed"></div>
<p>This result shows that \(\C\)-constructibility of complex numbers is the
same as constructibility of the real and imaginary parts, and that the
criterion for \(\C\)-constructibility is analogous to the criterion for
constructibility of real numbers. We can therefore simply speak of complex
numbers as being constructible or not, without any ambiguity.</p>
