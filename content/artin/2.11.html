<h2>Section 2.11. Product Groups</h2>
<p><span class="problem">Exercise 2.11.1</span> \((x, y)^n = 1\)
\(\Leftrightarrow\) (\(x^n = 1\) in \(G\) and \(y^n = 1\) in \(H\))
\(\Leftrightarrow\) (\(n\) is a multiple of both \(r\) and \(s\))
\(\Leftrightarrow\) \(n\) is a multiple of the LCM or \(r\) and \(s\).
Therefore the order of \((x, y)\) is exactly the LCM of \(r\) and \(s\).</p>
<p><span class="problem">Exercise 2.11.3</span> Let \(G\) and \(H\) be
infinite cyclic groups. Then \(G\) and \(H\) are each isomorphic to the
additive group of integers and their product is isomorphic to
\(\mathbb{Z}^2\) with elementwise addition. This group is not cyclic, since
each nonzero element generates a subgroup of \(\mathbb{Z}^2\) consisting only
of those lattice points that lie on the line joining the generator to the
origin. So \(G \times H\) is not cyclic either.</p>

<ol class="subproblems">
<li>Yes. \(H \cap K = \{1\}\), \(HK = G\), \(H\) and \(K\) are closed under
multiplication and under inverses, making them subgroups of \(G\), and they
are normal subgroups since \(G\) is abelian. Therefore the conditions of
Proposition 2.11.4(d) are satisifed.</li>
<li>No. The condition of Proposition 2.11.4(b) is violated. For example,
the matrices \(\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 2 \end{pmatrix}\) and
\(\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix}\), which lie in \(H\)
and \(K\), respectively, don't commute with each other.</li>
<li>Yes. \(H \cap K = \{1\}\), \(HK = G\) since a nonzero complex number
\(z\) can always be written as \((z/|z|)|z|\), and \(H\) and \(K\) are again
subgroups of \(G\), which are automatically normal as \(G\) is abelian. So
again Proposition 2.11.4(d) applies.</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="problem">Exercise 2.11.5</span> \((z_1, z_2) \in Z_1
\times Z_2\) \(\Leftrightarrow\) \(\forall (g_1, g_2) \in G_1 \times G_2,
(z_1, z_2)(g_1, g_2) = (z_1 g_1, z_2 g_2) = (g_1 z_1, g_2 z_2) =
(g_1, g_2)(z_1, z_2)\) \(\Leftrightarrow\) (\((z_1, z_2)\) is central).
Therefore, \(Z_1 \times Z_2\) is the centre of \(G_1 \times G_2\).</p>
<p><span class="problem">Exercise 2.11.6</span> A subgroup of order 3 must be
cyclic; we can write it in the form \(H = \{1, x, x^2\}\) for some \(x\).
Likewise a subgroup of order 5 must take the form \(K = \{1, y, y^2, y^3,
y^4\}\).  The intersection of these subgroups is necessarily \(\{1\}\) since
all non-identity elements of the former have order 3 and all non-identity
elements of the latter have order 5. According to Proposition
2.11.4(c), \(HK\) is a subgroup of \(G\). Since \(H\) and \(K\) are normal in
\(G\), they are also normal in \(HK\).
By Proposition 2.11.4(d), \(HK \cong H \times K \cong C_3 \times C_5\) and
therefore contains elements of order 15.</p>
<p><span class="problem">Exercise 2.11.7</span> We know that \(H \cap N =
\{1\}\), so Proposition 2.11.4(a) applies and the map is injective; also
since \(N\) is a normal subgroup of \(G\), Proposition 2.11.4(c) tells us
that the image is a subgroup of \(G\). However, the product map is not
necessarily a homomorphism since elements of \(H\) may not commute with
elements of \(N\).</p>
<p><span class="problem">Exercise 2.11.8</span> If \(\varphi, \varphi'\)
are homomorphisms \(H \to G\) and \(H \to G'\) respectively, then the pair
\((\varphi, \varphi')\) is mapped to the homomorphism \(\Phi(h) =
(\varphi(h), \varphi'(h))\). We can easily verify that \(\Phi\) is a
homomorphism whenever \(\varphi\) and \(\varphi'\) are. Conversely, if
\(\Phi : H \to G \times G'\) is a homomorphism, then there is exactly one pair
of functions \(\varphi : H \to G, \varphi' : H \to G'\) such that
\(\Phi(h) = (\varphi(h), \varphi'(h))\), namely, \(\varphi(h)\) must be the
first element of \(\Phi(h)\) and \(\varphi'(h)\) the second; the properties
of homomorphisms as applied to \(\Phi\) then imply that these properties are
satisfied for \(\varphi\) and \(\varphi'\) as well.</p>
<p><span class="problem">Exercise 2.11.9</span> Suppose first that \(HK = KH\).
Obviously \(1 \in HK\). Also for all \(h \in H, k \in K\), we have that
\((hk)^{-1} = k^{-1} h^{-1} \in KH = HK\), so \(HK\) is closed under
inverses; also, for all \(h_1, h_2 \in H, k_1, k_2 \in K\), we have that
\((h_1 k_1)(h_2 k_2) \in h_1 KH k_2 = h_1 HK k_2 \subseteq HK\), so \(HK\) is
closed under the operation of \(G\); therefore \(HK\) is a subgroup.</p>
<p>In the other direction, suppose \(HK\) is a subgroup of \(G\). Then for all
\(h \in H, k \in K\), we have \(kh = (h^{-1} k^{-1})^{-1} \in (HK)^{-1} =
HK\); therefore \(KH \subseteq HK\). Also for all \(x \in HK\), we have that
\(x^{-1} \in HK\), so \(x^{-1} = hk\) for some \(h \in H, k \in K\), whence
\(x = k^{-1} h^{-1} \in KH\); therefore \(HK \subseteq KH\). We conclude that
\(HK = KH\).</p>
