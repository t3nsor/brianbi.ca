<h2>Section 6.9. The Counting Formula</h2>
<p><span class="problem">Exercise 6.9.1</span> The group \(T\) of rotational
symmetries of the tetrahedron acts transitively on the vertices of a
tetrahedron, so the orbit of a vertex has size 4. The stabilizer of a vertex
consists of the three rotations around the axis passing through that vertex
and the centroid of the opposite face, with angles \(0, 2\pi/3, 4\pi/3\). So
in total the order of \(T\) is \(4 \times 3 = 12\).</p>
<p>The group \(O\) of rotational symmetries of the cube acts transitively on
the vertices of a cube, so the orbit of a vertex has size 8. The stabilizer of
a vertex again consists of three rotations, where the axis is the body diagonal
containing the vertex. So the order of \(O\) is \(8 \times 3 = 24\).</p>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 6.9.2</span> \(G_v\) consists of the
rotations through angles of 0, 120, and 240 degrees around the body diagonal
containing \(v\). These rotations fix \(v\) and the vertex opposite \(v\),
while \(G_v\) acts transitively on the three vertices adjacent to \(v\) and on
the three vertices adjacent to the opposite vertex. So the formula here is
\(8 = 1 + 1 + 3 + 3\).</p>
<p>\(G_e\) consists of the identity and the 180 degree rotation around the
axis joining the midpoint of \(e\) to the midpoint of the opposite edge.
These two edges are fixed by \(G_e\), while none of the other 10 edges are. So
the other 10 edges can be partitioned into 5 orbits consisting of 2 edges each,
where each edge is mapped to the other by the non-identity element of \(G_e\).
So the formula is \(12 = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2\).</p>
<p>\(G_f\) consists of the rotations through angles of 0, 90, 180, and 270
degrees around the axis that passes through the centre of \(f\) and the face
opposite to \(f\). These rotations fix \(f\) and the face opposite \(f\) while
\(G_f\) acts transitively on the other 4 faces. So the formula here is
\(6 = 1 + 1 + 4\).</p>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 6.9.3</span> The order of the group \(I\)
consisting of the orientation-preserving symmetries of a dodecahedron was
computed using the counting formula in Example 6.9.5(a); it equals 60. The
dodecahedron is also symmetric with respect to inversion, \(i\), which is
orientation-reversing. The map \(g \mapsto ig\) takes orientation-preserving
symmetries to orientation-reversing symmetries, is one-to-one, and is also onto
since if \(h\) is an orientation-reversing symmetry then \(i(ih) = h\) and
\(ih\) is orientation-preserving. This implies that there are also 60
orientation-reversing symmetries, for a total of 120.</p>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 6.9.4</span> Label the four vertices of the
tetrahedron as \(P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4\). Consider the scalar triple product
\(\Delta = \det(P_1 - P_2 \mid P_1 - P_3 \mid P_1 - P_4)\). Observe that any
orientation-preserving symmetry of the tetrahedron will preserve \(\Delta\)
while any orientation-reversing symmery will change the sign of \(\Delta\).
Also observe that \(\Delta\) changes sign under any transposition of two
vertices. This implies that an orientation-preserving symmetry must induce an
even permutation of the vertices while any orientation-reversing symmetry must
induce an odd permutation of the vertices. Say \(Q_1, Q_2, Q_3, Q_4\) is some
even permutation of the points \(P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4\); then if we perform some
rotation that maps \(P_1\) to \(Q_1\), since this induces an even permutation
of the four vertices, the remaining permutation required to bring the other
three vertices to their desired positions \(Q_2, Q_3, Q_4\) must also be even,
so it is some 3-cycle, which can be effected by a rotation around the axis
passing through \(Q_1\) and the centroid of the opposite face. This implies
that to each even permutation of the vertices there corresponds at least one
rotational symmetry of the tetrahedron. But there are 12 even permutations and
12 rotational symmetries, so these are in bijection. If on the other hand
\(Q_1, Q_2, Q_3, Q_4\) is an odd permutation of the points \(P_1, P_2, P_3,
P_4\) then we can first perform a reflection of the tetrahedron across one of
its planes of symmetry (which passes through a vertex and an altitude of the
opposite face) to make the remaining permutation required even, which can then
be effected by a rotation; this implies that to each of the 12 odd permutations
there corresponds some orientation-reversing symmetry of the tetrahedron that
induces that permutation on its vertices, and again, as there are 12 of the
latter, the two sets are in bijection. This implies that the full group of
symmetries of the tetrahedron is isomorphic to \(S_4\) when a symmetry is
identified with the permutation it induces on the tetrahedron's vertices, and
the orientation-preserving subgroup \(T\) is isomorphic to \(A_4\).</p>
