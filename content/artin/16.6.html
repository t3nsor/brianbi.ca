<h2>Section 16.6. Galois Theory</h2>
<p><em>Note from Brian:</em> My solutions to these problems don't seem very
Galois-theoretic. If you know of solutions that actually use the material
covered in this section, feel free to email me.</p>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 16.6.1</span> The polynomial \(x^3 + x + 1\)
is irreducible over \(\Q\), so \([\Q(\alpha) : \Q] = 3\). Since \(\sqrt{-31}\)
has degree 2 over \(\Q\), it can't be in this field. On the other hand,
according to (16.2.8), the discriminant of \(x^3 + x + 1\) is \(-31\), so
\(\sqrt{-31} = (z_1 - z_2)(z_1 - z_3)(z_2 - z_3)\) where \(z_1, z_2, z_3\) are
the roots of \(x^3 + x + 1\), where \(z_1\) is real, \(\Im(z_2) &gt; 0\), and
\(\Im(z_3) &lt; 0\). (We label the roots in this way only to get the correct
sign.) Therefore \(\sqrt{-31}\) is in the splitting field \(K\).</p>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 16.6.2</span> It can be shown fairly easily
that \(\sqrt{3} \notin \Q(\sqrt{2})\) and with a bit more algebra that
\(\sqrt{5} \notin \Q(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3})\), so the adjoinment of each square
root induces a quadratic extension, and \([K : \Q] = 8\). There are eight
automorphisms of \(K\) over \(\Q\) of the form \(A^a B^b C^c\) where
\(A(\sqrt{2}) = -\sqrt{2}, A(\sqrt{3}) = \sqrt{3}, A(\sqrt{5}) = \sqrt{5}\),
and similarly \(B\) and \(C\) each change the sign of one of the square roots,
and each exponent \(a, b, c\) is 0 or 1; this may be easily verified. So
\(\Gal(K/\Q)\) has order at least 8, and since \([K : \Q] = 8\), we conclude
that \(\Gal(K/\Q)\) has order exactly 8. The three automorphisms \(A, B, C\)
each have order 2, so \(\Gal(K/\Q) \cong C_2^3\).</p>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 16.6.3</span> We first observe that the claim
is not generally true in characteristic 2 (finding a counterexample is left as
an exercise for the reader). However, as of section 16.4 all fields are assumed
to have characteristic zero, so we proceed under that assumption.</p>
<!--A counterexample is given by letting \(F, L, K\) respectively be finite
fields of order 2, 4, and 16; since every element in a finite field of
characteristic 2 is a square, it follows that every polynomial of the form
\(x^4 + bx^2 + c\) factors as \((x^2 + \sqrt{b}x + \sqrt{c})^2\). -->
<p>According to Proposition 15.3.3, a quadratic extension is generated by the
square root of some element. There are two cases:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Case 1: \(K\) is generated over \(L\) by the square root of an element
of \(F\). Write \(L = F(\alpha), K = L(\beta)\), where \(\alpha^2, \beta^2 \in
F\). Let \(\zeta = \alpha + \beta\). Then \(\zeta\) is a root of the polynomial
\((x - \alpha - \beta)(x - \alpha + \beta)(x + \alpha - \beta)
(x + \alpha + \beta) = x^4 - 2(\alpha^2 + \beta^2)x^2 +
(\alpha^2 - \beta^2)^2\), which is of the desired form.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we have \(\zeta^3 = (\alpha^2 + 3\beta^2)\alpha +
(\beta^2 + 3\alpha^2)\beta\), so that
\begin{align*}
\alpha &amp;= \frac{(\beta^2 + 3\alpha^2)\zeta - \zeta^3}{2(\alpha^2 -
\beta^2)} \\
\beta &amp;= \frac{(\alpha^2 + 3\beta^2)\zeta - \zeta^3}{2(\beta^2 -
\alpha^2)}
\end{align*}
This establishes that \(\alpha \in F(\zeta)\), so in fact
\(L \subseteq F(\zeta)\); also, \(\beta \in F(\zeta)\), so
\(K = L(\beta) \subseteq F(\zeta)\), therefore \(K = F(\zeta)\).</p></li>
<li><p>Case 2: Writing \(L = F(\alpha)\) as before, with \(\alpha^2 \in F\),
\(K\) is generated over \(L\) by \(\beta\) where \(\beta^2 \in L\) but,
unlike in case 1, \(\beta^2 \notin F\). Write \(\beta^2 = p\alpha + q\), where
\(p, q \in F\), and \(p \ne 0\), so that \(\beta^2 \notin F\) as assumed. Then
\(\beta\) is a root of the polynomial \((x^2 - q)^2 = p^2 \alpha^2\), which can
also be written \(x^4 - 2qx^2 + (q^2 - p^2 \alpha^2) = 0\), which is of the
desired form. We also have that \(\alpha = p^{-1}(\beta^2 - q)\), therefore
\(F(\beta)\) contains \(\alpha\), therefore \(F(\beta)\) is all of
\(K\).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In both cases, since the root of the quartic described generates the
extension \(K/F\) of degree 4, the quartic is irreducible.</p>
