<h2>Section 16.4. Isomorphisms of Field Extensions</h2>
<p><span class="problem">Exercise 16.4.1(a)</span>
Every isomorphism of a field extension of \(\Q\) fixes \(\Q\). By Lemma
16.4.2(a), an automorphism of \(\Q(\sqrt[3]{2})\) must take
\(\sqrt[3]{2}\) to another root of \(x^3 - 2\). But \(\sqrt[3]{2}\) is the only
real root, so it must be mapped to itself. By Lemma 16.4.2(c), since \(x^3 -
2\) is irreducible, the \(\Q\)-automorphism of \(\Q(\sqrt[3]{2})\) is unique,
therefore it can only be the identity.</p>
<p>Lemma 16.4.2(a) implies that an automorphism of \(\Q(\sqrt[3]{2},\omega)\)
must map \(\sqrt[3]{2}\) to one of the three roots of the polynomial \(x^3 -
2\). Likewise \(\omega\), a root of the polynomial \(x^2 + x + 1\), must be
mapped to either itself or the other root, namely \(\omega^2\). Lemma 16.4.2(b)
implies that the automorphism will be completely determined by the choice of
these two mappings; so there are at most six distinct automorphisms of
\(\Q(\sqrt[3]{2},\omega)\).</p>
<p>Now, any
\(\Q(\sqrt[3]{2})\)-automorphism will also be a \(\Q\)-automorphism, and since
the polynomial \(x^2 + x + 1\) remains irreducible over \(\Q(\sqrt[3]{2})\),
Lemma 16.4.2(c) tells us that there are two automorphisms of
\(\Q(\sqrt[3]{2},\omega)\) that fix \(\Q(\sqrt[3]{2})\), one of which sends
\(\omega\) to \(\omega^2\); these form a subgroup \(\{1, \sigma\}\) of the full
automorphism group of \(\Q(\sqrt[3]{2},\omega)\).
By similar reasoning, and
the fact that \(x^3 - 2\) remains irreducible over \(\Q(\omega)\), we find
that there are three automorphisms of \(\Q(\sqrt[3]{2},\omega)\) that fix
\(\Q(\omega)\), which therefore form a subgroup \(\{1, \tau, \tau^2\}\) of
order 3.  The full automorphism
group of \(\Q(\sqrt[3]{2},\omega)\) must therefore have order divisible by 6,
therefore it is exactly 6, and the six automorphisms are
\(1, \sigma, \tau, \tau\sigma, \tau^2, \tau^2\sigma\).</p>

<p>The problem doesn't ask us to identify the isomorphism class of the
automorphism group. However, it's easy to do so. Say \(\tau(\sqrt[3]{2}) =
\omega\sqrt[3]{2}\). Then \(\sigma(\tau(\sqrt[3]{2})) =
\sigma(\omega\sqrt[3]{2}) = \sigma(\omega)\sigma(\sqrt[3]{2}) =
\omega^2\sqrt[3]{2}\), and \(\tau(\sigma(\sqrt[3]{2})) =
\tau(\sqrt[3]{2}) = \omega\sqrt[3]{2}\). Therefore \(\sigma\tau \ne
\tau\sigma\), and the automorphism group is nonabelian; therefore it is
isomorphic to \(S_3\).</p>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 16.4.1(b)</span> The given polynomial splits
completely in \(\Q(\sqrt{2})\) since its four roots in \(\C\) are
\(1 \pm \sqrt{2}\) and \(1 \pm 2\sqrt{2}\). It is also clear that
\(\Q(1 + \sqrt{2}) = \Q(\sqrt{2})\), so \(\Q(\sqrt{2})\) is the splitting
field. By Lemma 16.4.2(a) and (c), there are exactly two automorphisms of
this field: the identity, and one other that sends \(\sqrt{2}\) to
\(-\sqrt{2}\).</p>
