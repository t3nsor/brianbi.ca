<h2>Section 15.8. Primitive Elements</h2>
<p><span class="problem">Exercise 15.8.1</span> Suppose \(F\) is the finite
field \(\mathbb{F}_{p^r}\). Let \(K\) be a finite extension of \(F\). Then
\(K\) is also a finite field. According to Theorem 15.7.3(c), the group
\(K^\times\) is generated by some element \(\alpha\), so \(F(\alpha) = K\).</p>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 15.8.2</span> The field extension
\(\Q(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3})\) has degree 4 over \(\Q\), so if \(\alpha \in
\Q(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}\), then \(d = [\Q(\alpha) : \Q]\) can only be 1, 2, or 4.
Obviously \(d = 1\) exactly when \(\alpha \in \Q\). If \(d = 2\), then
\(\alpha\) is the root of some quadratic \(x^2 + ax + b\) with \(a, b \in \Q\);
this implies that \(\alpha = -\frac{a}{2} \pm \frac{\sqrt{a^2 - 4b}}{2}\), so
\(\alpha\) must take the form \(e + f\sqrt{g}\) for some \(e, f, g \in \Q\),
and we can choose \(g\) to be a squarefree nonnegative integer. We will use the
fact that \(\{1, \sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}, \sqrt{6}, \sqrt{g}\}\) will be linearly
independent over \(\Q\) if \(g\) is any squarefree integer other than 1, 2, 3,
or 6. This implies that \(g \in \{1, 2, 3, 6\}\). So if
\(\alpha = p + q\sqrt{2} + r\sqrt{3} + s\sqrt{6}\) where \(p, q, r, s \in \Q\),
then \(\alpha\) must be primitive (have degree 4) whenever at least two of
\(q, r, s\) are nonzero, and it is easy to see that this condition is also
necessary.</p>
