<h2>Section 11.4. Quotient Rings</h2>
<p><span class="problem">Exercise 11.4.1</span> The given homomorphism (let us
denote it by \(\varphi\)) is surjective. The kernel \(K\) of \(\varphi\) is the
ideal generated by \(x - 1\). The Correspondence Theorem asserts that ideals of
\(\mathbb{Z}[x]\) that contain \(x - 1\) are in bijection with their images in
\(\mathbb{Z}\), which are ideals of \(\mathbb{Z}\). By enumerating all ideals
of \(\mathbb{Z}\), we can determine all ideals of \(\mathbb{Z}[x]\) that
contain \(x - 1\). By Proposition 11.3.21, the ideals of \(\mathbb{Z}\) are
principal ideals generated by some \(n \in \mathbb{Z}\). The inverse image
\(\varphi^{-1}(n\mathbb{Z})\) consists of the polynomials \(f \in
\mathbb{Z}[x]\) satisfying \(f(1) \in n\mathbb{Z}\). An equivalent condition
is that polynomial division of \(f\) by \(x - 1\) yields \((x - 1)g + r\)
where \(r\) is a constant divisible by \(n\). Therefore the ideal
\(\varphi^{-1}(n\mathbb{Z})\) is \((x - 1, n)\), that is, all ideals of
\(\mathbb{Z}[x]\) that contain \(x - 1\) are generated by \(x - 1\) together
with a constant (possibly 0 in the case of \(K\) itself).</p>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 11.4.2</span> Let \(\varphi\) be the
homomorphism from \(\mathbb{Z}[x]\) to \(\mathbb{Z}[i]\) that sends \(x\) to
\(i\). Then \(\varphi\) is surjective; the value \(a + bi\) is the image of
the polynomial \(a + bx\). The kernel of \(\varphi\) is the ideal \(K\)
generated by \(x^2 + 1\). The Correspondence Theorem therefore tells us that
the ideals of \(\mathbb{Z}[x]\) containing \(x^2 + 1\) are precisely the
inverse images of ideals of \(\mathbb{Z}[i]\) under \(\varphi\).</p>
<p>It turns out that \(\mathbb{Z}[i]\) is a principal ideal domain, although
it's not clear whether Artin expects us to know this at this point in the text.
So in fact each ideal \(I \subseteq \mathbb{Z}[i]\) can be identified by a
generator \(a + bi\) and \(\varphi^{-1}(I)\) is then generated by \(x^2 + 1\)
together with \(a + bx\), and every ideal of \(\mathbb{Z}[x]\) containing
\(x^2 + 1\) takes this form.</p>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 11.4.3</span></p>
<ol class="subproblems">
<li>It's not clear what the question is asking us to do when it asks to
<q>identify</q> the ring, but here goes. Let \(I = (x^2 - 3, 2x + 4)\). Then
\(2 \in I\) since \(2 = (2 - x)(2x + 4) + 2(x^2 - 3)\). Consider the
homomorphism \(\varphi : \mathbb{Z}[x] \to \mathbb{F}_2[x]\) such that
\(\varphi(x) = x\). Clearly \(\varphi\) is surjective and its kernel is
\((2)\). Since \((2) \subseteq I\), the Correspondence Theorem tells us that
\(\mathbb{Z}[x]/I \cong \mathbb{F}_2[x]/\varphi(I)\). Now \(\varphi(I)
= (\varphi(x^2 - 3), \varphi(2x + 4)) = (\varphi(x^2 - 3)) =
(x^2 - 1) = ((x - 1)^2)\), so \(\mathbb{Z}[x]/I \cong
\mathbb{F}_2[x]/((x - 1)^2) \cong \mathbb{F}_2[y + 1]/(y^2) \cong
\mathbb{F}_2[y]/(y^2)\) (where \(y = x - 1\)).
So this ring has 4 elements.</li>
<li>This problem parallels Exercise 11.4.5. By the Correspondence Theorem,
\(\mathbb{Z}[i]/(2+i) \cong \mathbb{Z}[x]/(x^2 + 1, 2 + x)\), and letting
\(\varphi : \mathbb{Z}[x] \to \mathbb{Z}\) be defined by \(\varphi(f) =
f(-2)\), we obtain \(\mathbb{Z}[x]/(x^2 + 1, 2 + x) \cong
\mathbb{Z}/(\varphi(x^2 + 1)) = \mathbb{Z}/5\mathbb{Z}\). This should not be
surprising since \(2 + i\) generates the same ideal of \(\mathbb{Z}[i]\) as
\(i - 2\) does.</li>
<li>Let \(I = (6, 2x - 1)\). Then \(x + 1 = x^2(6) - (3x+1)(2x - 1) \in I\).
Define \(\varphi : \mathbb{Z}[x] \to \mathbb{Z}\) by \(\varphi(f) = f(-1)\).
Then \(\varphi\) is surjective and its kernel \((x + 1)\) is contained in
\(I\). Therefore \(\mathbb{Z}[x]/I \cong \mathbb{Z}/\varphi(I) =
\mathbb{Z}/(\varphi(6), \varphi(2x - 1)) = \mathbb{Z}/(6, -3) =
\mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z}\).</li>
<li>Let \(I = (2x^2 - 4, 4x - 5)\). Then \(x - 3 = 2(2x^2 - 4) -
(x + 1)(4x - 5) \in I\). Define \(\varphi : \mathbb{Z}[x] \to \mathbb{Z}\)
by \(\varphi(f) = f(3)\). Then \(\varphi\) is surjective and its kernel
\((x - 3)\) is contained in \(I\). Therefore \(\mathbb{Z}[x]/I \cong
\mathbb{Z}/\varphi(I) = \mathbb{Z}/(\varphi(2x^2 - 4), \varphi(4x - 5)) =
\mathbb{Z}/(14, 7) = \mathbb{Z}/7\mathbb{Z}\).</li>
<li>\(\mathbb{Z}[x]/(x^2 + 3, 5) \cong \mathbb{F}_5[x]/(x^2 + 3)\). Since
\(-3\) is not a square modulo 5, \(x^2 + 3\) is irreducible over
\(\mathbb{F}_5\), so this ring is a finite field of order 25 (<i>cf.</i>
Example 11.5.7(b)).</li>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 11.4.4</span> They are not isomorphic. Here
is one way to see this: let \(\pi_1\) and \(\pi_2\) be the canonical maps from
\(\mathbb{Z}[x]\) to \(\mathbb{Z}[x]/(x^2 + 7)\) and \(\mathbb{Z}[x]/(2x^2 +
7)\), respectively. We have \(\pi_1(x)^2 = \pi_1(x^2) = -7\). If the two
quotient rings were isomorphic then \(\pi_1(x)\) would have to be mapped to
an element of \(\mathbb{Z}[x]/(2x^2 + 7)\) that also squares to \(-7\), since
any isomorphism between the two rings must preserve the integers. Let
\(P(x)\) be a polynomial such that \(\pi_2(P(x))^2 = -7\). Now
\(\pi_2(P(x))^2 = \pi_2(P(x)^2) = -7\) implies \(P(x)^2 = Q(x)(2x^2 + 7) -7\)
where \(Q(x) \in \mathbb{Z}[x]\). If
\(P\) is regarded as a polynomial over \(\mathbb{C}\), then substituting
\(x = \sqrt{-7/2}\) yields \(P(\sqrt{-7/2})^2 = -7\) so \(P(\sqrt{-7/2}) =
\sqrt{-7}\).  But all even powers of \(\sqrt{-7/2}\) are rational
and all odd powers are rational multiples of \(\sqrt{-7/2}\) so this implies
\(r_1 + r_2\sqrt{-7/2} = \sqrt{-7}\), which is not possible as \(1,
\sqrt{-7/2}, \sqrt{-7}\) are linearly independent over \(\mathbb{Q}\). So it is
not possible to construct an isomorphism between the two quotient rings.</p>
