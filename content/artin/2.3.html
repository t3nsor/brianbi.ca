<h2>Section 2.3. Subgroups of the Additive Group of Integers</h2>
<p><span class="problem">Exercise 2.3.3(a)</span> Let \(S\) be a nonempty,
possibly infinite set of integers. If \(S = \{0\}\), then define the GCD to be
0. Otherwise, the subgroup of \(\mathbb{Z}^+\) generated by \(S\) contains a
least positive element \(d\) and by Theorem 2.3.3, this subgroup is precisely
\(d\mathbb{Z}\). We define the GCD of \(S\) to be \(d\).</p>
