<h2>Section 15.4. Finding the Irreducible Polynomial</h2>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 15.4.1</span> We know that \(\{1, \alpha,
\alpha^2\}\) forms a \(\Q\)-basis of \(\Q(\alpha)\), and we know that
\(\alpha^3 = \alpha + 1\). Therefore
\begin{align*}
\gamma^2 &amp;= 1 + 2\alpha^2 + \alpha^4 \\
&amp;= 1 + 2\alpha^2 + \alpha(\alpha + 1) \\
&amp;= 1 + \alpha + 3\alpha^2
\end{align*}
and if \(p\gamma^2 + q\gamma + r = 0\) with \(p, q, r \in \Q\) then we have
\(0 = p(1 + \alpha + 3\alpha^2) + q(1 + \alpha^2) + r =
(p + q + r) + p\alpha + (3p + q)\alpha^2\) implying
\(p + q + r = p = 3p + q = 0\) so \(p = q = r = 0\). So the minimal polynomial
has degree at least 3. Now
\begin{align*}
\gamma^3 &amp;= (1 + \alpha^2)(1 + \alpha + 3\alpha^2) \\
&amp;= 1 + \alpha + 3\alpha^2 + \alpha^2 + \alpha^3 + 3\alpha^4 \\
&amp;= 1 + \alpha + 4\alpha^2 + \alpha + 1 + 3\alpha^2 + 3\alpha \\
&amp;= 2 + 5\alpha + 7\alpha^2
\end{align*}
and by inspection
\begin{equation*}
\gamma^3 - 5\gamma^2 = -8\alpha^2 - 3 = -8\gamma + 5
\end{equation*}
so \(\gamma^3 - 5\gamma^2 + 8\gamma - 5 = 0\) and the minimal polynomial is
\(x^3 - 5x^2 + 8x - 5\).</p>

<ol class="subproblems">
<li><p>By a similar argument to that used in
<a href="http://brianbi.ca/artin/11.3">Exercise 11.3.3(d)</a> we find that
if \(f(\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{5}) = 0\) and \(f \in \Q[x]\) then we must have
\(f(\pm \sqrt{3} \pm \sqrt{5}) = 0\) so that \(f\) has degree at least 4.
In fact \(\prod (x \pm \sqrt{3} \pm \sqrt{5}) = x^4 - 16x^2 + 4 \in \Q[x]\) so
this is the minimal polynomial.</p></li>
<li><p>Since \(\sqrt{5}\) generates a quadratic extension of \(\Q\) while
\(\alpha\) generates an extension of degree 4, it is not possible
that \(\alpha \in \Q(\sqrt{5})\), so the minimal polynomial has
degree at least 2. Now \(\alpha^2 = 8 + 2\sqrt{15}\) and \(\sqrt{5}\alpha =
\sqrt{15} + 5\) so we have \(\alpha^2 - 2\sqrt{5}\alpha = -2\) so the minimal
polynomial is \(x^2 - 2\sqrt{5}x + 2\).</p></li>
<li><p>We first observe that \(\Q(\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{5})\) is a field extension of
\(\Q\) of degree 4 that contains \(\Q(\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{5})\), so the two fields
are equal.</p>
<p>Now we'll show that \(\sqrt{10} \notin \Q(\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{5})\).
Suppose for the sake of contradiction that \(\sqrt{10} = a + b\sqrt{5}\) where
\(a, b \in \Q(\sqrt{3})\). Then squaring both sides gives \(10 = a^2 + 5b^2 +
2ab\sqrt{5}\), and since \(\{1, \sqrt{5}\}\) is a \(\Q(\sqrt{3})\)-basis of
\(\Q(\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{5})\), this implies \(2ab = 0\). So either \(a = 0\) or
\(b = 0\). If \(a = 0\), then \(b\sqrt{5} = \sqrt{10}\) so \(b = \sqrt{2}\),
but \(\sqrt{2} \notin \Q(\sqrt{3})\). If on the other hand \(b = 0\), then
\(\sqrt{10} = a\), but \(\sqrt{10} \notin \Q(\sqrt{3})\) so this is not
possible either. So in fact our assumption that \(\sqrt{10} \in
\Q(\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{5})\) must have been wrong.</p>
<p>This implies that \(\Q(\alpha, \sqrt{10})\) is a quadratic
extension of \(\Q(\alpha)\) so it has degree 8 over \(\Q\). Then
\([\Q(\alpha, \sqrt{10}) : \Q(\sqrt{10})] = [\Q(\alpha, \sqrt{10}) : \Q] /
[\Q(\sqrt{10}) : \Q] = 8/2 = 4\). So the minimal polynomial of \(\alpha\) over
\(\Q(\sqrt{10})\) is the same as over \(\Q\).</p></li>
<li><p>By the same argument as in part (b), the minimal polynomial has degree
at least 2 and it is easy to see that it is simply
\(x^2 - (8 + 2\sqrt{15})\).</p></li>
</ol>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 15.4.3</span> The basis given in Example
15.4.4(b) can also be written in the form \(\{1, \sqrt[3]{2}, \sqrt[3]{4},
\omega, \omega\sqrt[3]{2}, \omega\sqrt[3]{4}\}\) where
\(\omega = e^{2\pi i/3}\).
Using this it is easy to compute
\begin{align*}
\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 &amp;= \sqrt[3]{2} + \omega\sqrt[3]{2} \\
(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2)^2 &amp;= \omega\sqrt[3]{4} \\
(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2)^3 &amp;= -2
\end{align*}
and to see that \(\{1, \alpha_1 + \alpha_2, (\alpha_1 + \alpha_2)^2\}\) is
linearly independent over \(\Q\) but \((\alpha_1 + \alpha_2)^3 + 2 = 0\), so
the minimal polynomial is \(x^3 + 2\).</p>
