<ol class="subproblems">
<li>The identity function is obviously an automorphism of \(G\). If \(\varphi
\in \Aut G\), then \(\varphi^{-1}\) is also a bijection. Suppose
\(a, b \in G\), and let \(c = \varphi^{-1}(a),
d = \varphi^{-1}(b)\). Then \(a = \varphi(c), b = \varphi(d)\), so
\(ab = \varphi(cd)\), so \(\varphi^{-1}(ab) = cd = \varphi^{-1}(a)
\varphi^{-1}(b)\), so \(\varphi^{-1}\) preserves the operation of \(G\). Thus,
the inverse of an automorphism on \(G\) is always an automorphism on \(G\).
Now consider two automorphisms \(\varphi_1, \varphi_2\) of \(G\). Then
for every \(a, b \in
G\), \(\varphi_1 \circ \varphi_2(ab) = \varphi_1(\varphi_2(a)\varphi_2(b))
= \varphi_1(\varphi_2(a))\varphi_1(\varphi_2(b)) =
(\varphi_1 \circ \varphi_2(a))(\varphi_1 \circ \varphi_2(b))\), so
\(\varphi_1 \circ \varphi_2\) preserves the operation of \(G\). And since
\(\varphi_1, \varphi_2\) are both bijections on the set \(G\), so is their
composition. Therefore \(\varphi_1 \circ \varphi_2\) is an automorphism, and
\(\Aut G\) is closed under composition. These results
together establish that \(\Aut G\) is a group under the operation of
composition.</li>
<li>Denote the operation of conjugation by \(g\) by \(C_g\). First, fix \(g\)
and consider the function \(C_g\). For every \(h_1, h_2 \in H\), we have that
\(C_g(h_1 h_2) = gh_1 h_2 g^{-1} = (gh_1 g^{-1})(gh_2 g^{-1})
= C_g(h_1) C_g(h_2)\). Therefore \(C_g\) is a homomorphism for each \(g\). It
is also injective, because if \(C_g(h) = 1\) then \(ghg^{-1} = 1\), which we
can rearrange to yield \(h = 1\). Therefore \(C_g\) is an automorphism for
each \(g\). So far we know that \(\varphi\) which sends \(g\) to \(C_g\) is a
function from \(G\) to \(\Aut G\). We now need to show that it is a
homomorphism. Let \(g, g' \in G\). Then \(C_g \circ C_{g'}\)
is the operation \(h \mapsto gg'hg'^{-1}g^{-1}\), which is
\(C_{gg'}(h)\), so \(\varphi(gg') = \varphi(g)\varphi(g')\) for all \(g, g'
\in G\). So \(\varphi\) is indeed a homomorphism.  The kernel
consists of those elements of \(G\) by which conjugation is the identity
operation, that is, \(g\) such that \(ghg^{-1} = h\) for all \(h \in G\).
Such \(g\) are the elements that commute with all elements of \(G\), that is,
\(\ker \varphi\) is the centre of \(G\).</li>
<li>It is clear enough that the inner automorphisms form a group, since they
are the image of the homomorphism \(\varphi\). Suppose \(i\) is an inner
automorphism of \(G\), which conjugates by
\(g \in G\). Suppose \(a\) is some arbitrary
automorphism of \(G\). Let \(h \in G\). Then \(a \circ i \circ a^{-1}(h)
= a(ga^{-1}(h)g^{-1}) = a(g)a(a^{-1}(h))a(g^{-1}) = a(g)h(a(g))^{-1}\).
That is, the automorphism \(aia^{-1}\) is conjugation by \(a(g)\), which is
another inner automorphism. Since this holds for all \(i, a\), the inner
automorphism group is normal.</li></ol>

<p><span class="problem">Problem 6.M.3</span></p>
<ol class="subproblems">
<li>We previously argued (see <a href="/artin/2.6">Exercise 2.6.10(a)</a>)
that the automorphisms of \(C_n\) are precisely the maps \(\varphi_k\) defined
by \(\varphi_k(x) = kx\) for each \(k\) relatively prime to \(n\), where we
restrict \(k\) to be between 1 and \(n-1\) to avoid duplicates. It's easy to
see that the composition of such automorphisms is given by \(\varphi_k
\circ \varphi_{k'} = \varphi_{kk'}\). In the case \(n = 4\), there are two
automorphisms, \(\varphi_1\) and \(\varphi_3\), so the group of these two
automorphisms is isomorphic to \(C_2\).</li>
<li>Here again there are only two automorphisms since only 1 and 5 are
relatively prime to 6. Again, the automorphism group is simply \(C_2\).</li>
<li>The group \(C_2 \times C_2\) consists of the identity and the elements
\(x = (1, 0), y = (0, 1), xy = (1, 1)\), with the operation being elementwise
addition modulo 2. The three elements \(x, y, xy\) all have order 2 and the
product of any pair of them in either order equals the third. Any automorphism
of \(C_2 \times C_2\) must fix 1 so there are 6 candidate automorphisms,
one for each permutation of \(\{x, y, xy\}\). Each of these 6 permutations
is a valid automorphism since the property of \(x, y, xy\) having order 2 and
having the product of each two be the third is preserved by any permutation
of these three elements. Therefore, \(\Aut(C_2 \times C_2) \cong S_3\).</li>
<li>The group \(D_4\) is generated by \(\rho\) and \(r\) with the relations
\(\rho^4 = 1, r^2 = 1, r\rho = \rho^{-1}r\). The elements \(\rho\) and
\(\rho^3\) are the only ones with order 4. Therefore if \(\varphi\) is an
automorphism of \(D_4\), it must either map \(\rho\) to \(\rho\) or
\(\rho\) to \(\rho^{-1}\). Since \(\rho, r\) generate \(D_4\), the automorphism
is completely determined by \(\varphi(\rho)\) and \(\varphi(r)\). Since
\(\varphi\) maps rotations to rotations, there are 4 possible choices for
\(\varphi(r)\), so there are at most 8 possible automorphisms of \(D_4\).
Denote the automorphism that maps \(\rho\) to \(\rho^i\) with \(i \in \{1,
-1\}\) and \(r\) to \(\rho^j r\) with \(j \in \{0, 1, 2, 3\}\) by
\(\varphi_{ij}\). Then \(\varphi_{ij}\) maps \(r\) to an element of order 2
and maps \(\rho\) to an element of order 4, and \(\varphi_{ij}(r)
\varphi_{ij}(\rho) = \rho^j r \rho^i = \rho^{j-i} r =
(\rho^i)^{-1}(\rho^j r) = \varphi_{ij}(\rho)^{-1} \varphi_{ij}(r)\), so
\(\varphi_{ij}\) preserves the defining relations of \(D_4\). This establishes
that each possible \(\varphi_{ij}\) is indeed a valid automorphism of
\(D_4\) and there are no others.</p>
<p>Now \(P = \varphi_{1,1}\) acts as a 4-cycle on the elements
\(S = \{r, \rho r, \rho^2 r, \rho^3 r\}\) while \(R = \varphi_{-1,0}\) maps
\(r \mapsto r, \rho r \mapsto \rho^3 r, \rho^2 r \mapsto \rho^2 r, \rho^3 r
\mapsto \rho r\). That is, \(P\) and \(R\) permute \(S\)
in the same way that \(\rho\) and \(r\) permute the four corners of a square.
The action of \(D_4\) on the vertices of the square is faithful, so there are
8 distinct permutations of the vertices of the square generated by the action
of \(\rho\) and \(r\), which implies that all 8 permutations of \(S\) are
represented among the action of the subgroup of \(\Aut D_4\) generated by
\(P\) and \(R\). Since \(|\Aut D_4| = 8\), this is the entire group
\(\Aut D_4\), and its action on \(S\) is faithful. This implies that the
law of composition of elements of \(\Aut D_4\) is given by the composition of
permutations by which elements of \(\Aut D_4\) act. The same is true of
\(D_4\) itself, when regarded as acting on the 4 elements of \(S\). Therefore
\(\Aut D_4 \cong D_4\).</p></li>
<li>Every automorphism of \(H\) fixes \(-1\), which is the only element of
order 2. An automorphism therefore permutes the other 6 elements \(\pm i,
\pm j, \pm k\). We argue that \(\Aut H\) is isomorphic to the group of
rotational symmetries of a cube. To see this, label the faces of a cube with
the symbols \(\pm i, \pm j, \pm k\) so that \(\pm i\) label opposite faces
and similarly with \(\pm j\) and \(\pm k\), and the arrangement of the faces
\(i, j, k\) around their common vertex is counterclockwise. By inspection,
we see that the product of any two faces is either \(-1\) if they are opposite
faces, or else is given by the unique third face such that the first factor,
the second factor, and the product occur in counterclockwise order around their
common vertex. Let \(\varphi\) be an automorphism of \(H\). Then \(\varphi\)
maps opposite faces to opposite faces (as opposite faces of the cube are
labelled with inverse elements of \(H\)), so it maps the elements \(i, j, k\)
to three faces \(\varphi(i), \varphi(j), \varphi(k)\) that meet at a common
vertex and occur in counterclockwise order around that vertex. Now, each
permutation of the faces of the cube with this property is induced by a
unique rotational symmetry of the cube, namely the one that maps the common
vertex of \(i, j, k\) to the common vertex of \(\varphi(i), \varphi(j),
\varphi(k)\) (which preserves the counterclockwise orientation) and then
rotates those three faces to achieve the desired final configuration. That is,
to each automorphism of \(H\) there corresponds a unique rotational symmetry
of the cube. Conversely, if \(g\) is some rotational symmetry of the cube, then
the permutation it induces on the symbols \(\pm i, \pm j, \pm k\) is an
automorphism of \(H\), because \(g\) maps opposite faces to opposite faces
(thus preserving inverses) and because if \(a, b \in H \setminus \{-1, 1\}\)
then the faces labelled with \(a, b, ab\) on the cube will be mapped to
three faces that also meet at a common vertex and occur in counterclockwise
order, which therefore correspond to three elements in \(H \setminus
\{-1, 1\}\) with the third being the product of the first and second. (Note
that any permutation of \(H \setminus \{-1, 1\}\) preserves the products of
an element from this set and either \(+1\) or \(-1\).) This establishes that
the automorphisms of \(H\) are in bijection with the elements of \(O\).
Obviously, the composition of two elements in \(O\) permutes the elements of
\(H \setminus \{-1, 1\}\) in the same way as the two elements acting one after
another, so \(\Aut H \cong O\). (Note: an argument similar to that used in
<a href="/artin/6.12">Exercise 6.12.3</a> can be used to show that \(O\) acts
faithfully on the 4 body diagonals of the cube, so alternatively
\(\Aut H \cong S_4\).)</li>

<ol class="subproblems">
<li>We claim that the order of \(G_n\) is \(n! 2^n\). We will prove this by
induction. The cases \(n = 1, n = 2\) are easy and \(n = 2\) can serve as a
base case. Assume the order of \(G_{n-1}\) is \((n-1)!2^{n-1}\). The group
\(G_n\) acts transitively on the \(2n\) facets of \(\mathcal{C}_n\). Let
\(F\) be the facet consisting of the vertices \((1, \pm 1, \pm 1, \ldots,
\pm 1)\). The centre of \(F\) is therefore \((1, 0, \ldots, 0)\), and the
axis joining \(F\) to the centre of \(\mathcal{C}_n\) is the \(e_1\) axis.
Suppose \(g\) is an isometry that fixes \(F\) and therefore the centre of
\(F\); this automatically fixes the centre of the opposite facet \((-1, 0,
\ldots, 0)\) as well. The matrix of \(g\) is an
orthogonal matrix whose first column is \((1, 0, \ldots, 0)^t\). Since the
columns of an orthogonal matrix are orthonormal, this implies that the first
row of \(g\) is also \((1, 0, \ldots, 0)\), and the \((n - 1) \times (n - 1)\)
matrix formed by deleting the first row and column can be any orthogonal
matrix. That is, \(g\) acts as an isometry \(g'\) on the \((n-1)\)-dimensional
hyperplane perpendicular to \(e_1\) and every such isometry can be extended
to a unique isometry of \(\mathbb{R}^n\) that fixes the centre of \(F\).
In order for \(g\) to be a symmetry of \(\mathcal{C}_n\), it is sufficient and
necessary for \(g'\) to be a symmetry of the intersection of \(\mathcal{C}_n\)
with the \((n-1)\)-dimensional hyperplane perpendicular to \(e_1\), which is
the set \(\{(0, x_2, x_3, \ldots, x_n) \mid -1 \leq x_i \leq +1\}\), and is
therefore an \((n-1)\)-dimensional hypercube. (It is sufficient because
\(g\) will then fix the set of all \(n\) coordinate axes consisting of
\(e_1\) and the \(n-1\) axes \(e_2, \ldots, e_n\) which are obtained as the
joining opposite facets of the \((n-1)\)-dimensional hypercube, and these
\(n\) coordinate axes then determine the position of the \(n\)-dimensional
hypercube.) By the induction hypothesis, there are \((n-1)!2^{n-1}\) choices
for \(g'\), thus the stabilizer of the centre of \(F\) (and thus \(F\) itself)
has order \((n-1)!2^{n-1}\). The order of the entire \(\mathcal{C}_n\) is
therefore \(2n(n-1)!2^{n-1} = n!2^n\).</li>
<li>The \(n!2^n\) matrices that are obtained by taking some \(n \times n\)
permutation matrix and then changing the sign of some subset of the entries are
all orthogonal, form a group, and all map vertices of \(\mathcal{C}_n\) to
vertices, so this group of matrices is precisely the group \(G_n\). Such a
matrix maps \((1, 1, \ldots, 1)^t\) to the element-wise sum of its \(n\) column
vectors, so an element of \(G_n\) stabilizes this vertex iff all its entries
are positive. That is, the stabilizer of this vertex is the group of
\(n \times n\) permutation matrices. Now the proper rotations in \(G_2\) are
generated by the matrix
\[
P = \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; -1 \\ 1 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix}
\]
which permutes the four column vectors \((1, 1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1), (1, -1)\)
in a 4-cycle, and \(P\) together with the orientation-reversing matrix
\[
R = \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix}
\]
which permutes the same four vectors by transposing \((1, -1)\) and
\((-1, 1)\). That is, \(P\) and \(R\) act on these four vectors in the same
way as \(\rho, r \in D_4\), respectively. By an argument analogous to that used
in Problem 6.M.3(d), we conclude that \(G_2 \cong D_4\), as we expect.</li>

<li>Denoting the generators of \(D_3\) by \(\rho\) and \(r\) where \(\rho\) is

<li>The number \(|G_s|\) is just the number of <q>true</q> entries in the
column of the table, so \(\sum_{s\in S} |G_s|\) is the total number of
<q>true</q> entries in the table. Similarly \(|S^g|\) is the number of
<q>true</q> entries in the row of the table, so \(\sum_{g \in G} |S^g|\) is
also the total number of <q>true</q> entries in the table.</li>

= |G| \sum_{s \in S} \frac{1}{|O_s|}\), where we write \(O_s\) for the orbit
containing \(s\). Since each element of \(S\) is contained in exactly one
orbit, we can rewrite this sum as \(|G| \sum_{O \in \mathcal{O}}
\sum_{s \in O} \frac{1}{|O_s|} = |G| \sum_{O \in \mathcal{O}}
\frac{|O|}{|O|} = |G||\mathcal{O}|\).<div class="qed"></div></li>

<p><span class="problem">Problem 6.M.8</span> Label the 8 edges of the octagon
with the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 in order. Let \(\rho\) denote a
rotation by angle \(\pi/4\) and \(r\) a reflection that fixes two vertices of
the octagon. The identity element
fixes all 70 colorings. The element \(\rho\) doesn't fix any of the colorings
(in order for it to do so, all 8 edges would have to have the same color).
Likewise \(\rho^3, \rho^5, \rho^7\), which also cycle each edge through the
set of all 8 edges, don't fix any of the colorings. The colorings fixed by
\(\rho^2\) and \(\rho^6\) are those such that alternating edges have the same
color, of which there are two. The colorings fixed by \(\rho^4\) are those
where each edge has the same color as its opposite edge. Two pairs of opposite
edges must therefore be white, so there are \(\binom{4}{2} = 6\) elements
fixed by \(\rho^4\). The reflection \(r\) exchanges four pairs of edges so it
fixes those colorings where the two edges in each pair have the same color;
again, two of these pairs must be white, so there are 6 elements fixed by
\(r\). The reflections \(\rho^2 r, \rho^4 r, \rho^6 r\) perform the same kind
of reflection, so each of these also fixes 6 colorings. Finally, the other
four reflections \(\rho^k r\) with \(k\) odd each fix two sides and exchange
the sides in three other pairs. A coloring fixed by such a reflection therefore
has an even number of black sides among the 6 non-fixed sides, implying that
the two fixed sides must have the same color. If the two fixed sides are
black, we can choose one of the other three pairs to be black, and likewise if
the two fixed sides are white then we can choose one of the other three pairs
to be white. This implies that each such reflection fixes 6 colorings. In all,
\begin{align*}
\sum_{g \in G} |S^g|
&amp;= S^1 + 4S^\rho + 2S^{\rho^2} + S^{\rho^4} +
4S^r + 4S^{\rho r} \\
&amp;= 70 + 4\times 0 + 2 \times 2 + 6 + 4\times 6 + 4\times 6 \\
&amp;= 128
\end{align*}
so the number of orbits is \(128 \divides |D_8| = 8\). Representatives of
these orbits are 0123, 0124, 0125, 0134, 0135, 0136, 0145, 0246, where each
set of 4 digits represents a set of edges to be colored black.</p>
