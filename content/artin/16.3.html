<h2>Section 16.3. Splitting Fields</h2>
<p><span class="problem">Exercise 16.3.1</span> We prove the claim by
induction on degree. In the base case, the polynomial has degree 1 and the
claim is obvious. Now assume the claim is proved for all degrees smaller than
\(n\) and suppose \(f\) has degree \(n\).</p>
<p>Suppose first that \(f\) is irreducible. Let \(\alpha \in K\) be one of the
roots of \(f\), so that \(f(x) = (x - \alpha)g(x)\). Clearly,
\([F(\alpha) : F] = n\) and \(g(x) \in F(\alpha)[x]\). There exists a field
\(L\) with \(F(\alpha) \subseteq L \subseteq K\) that is a splitting field of
\(g\), since \(g\) splits completely in \(K\), and by the inductive hypothesis,
\([L : F(\alpha)] \divides (n-1)!\). In fact, since \(L\) contains all the
roots of \(g\) as well as \(\alpha\), it contains all the roots of \(f\),
therefore \(K \subseteq L\). This implies \(K = L\). Thus,
\([K : F] = [K : F(\alpha)][F(\alpha) : F] = n[K : F(\alpha)] \divides
n(n-1)! = n!\).</p>
<p>Now consider the case where \(f\) isn't irreducible. Write \(f = gh\), where
\(g\) and \(h\) both have positive degree.
Let \(F'\) be the subfield of \(K\) obtained by
adjoining the roots of \(g\) to \(F\); then \(F'\) is a splitting field for
\(g\), and by the induction hypothesis, \([F' : F] \divides (\deg g)!\).
Furthermore, adjoining the roots of \(h\) to \(F'\) must yield \(K\), so
\(K\) is a splitting field for \(h\) when considered as a polynomial over
\(F'\); the induction hypothesis implies \([K : F'] \divides (\deg h)!\).
Thus, \([K : F] = [K : F'][F' : F] \divides (\deg g)!(\deg h)! \divides
(\deg g + \deg h)! = n!\).</p>

<ol class="subproblems">
<li>It is clear that \(x^3 - 2\) is irreducible, so that adjoining the root
\(\sqrt[3]{2}\) to \(\Q\) produces a field extension of degree 3. But
\(\Q(\sqrt[3]{2})\) is still a subfield of \(\R\), so it doesn't contain the
two complex roots of \(x^3 - 2\). Therefore 3 is a proper divisor of the degree
of the splitting field of \(x^3 - 2\). But Exercise 16.3.1 implies that the
degree of the splitting field divides 6. Therefore, it must be equal to 6.</li>
<li>We have the factorization \(x^4 - 1 = (x^2 + 1)(x + 1)(x - 1)\) and clearly
\(x^2 + 1\) is irreducible over \(\Q\). It is easy to see that \(\Q(i)\) is a
splitting field for \(x^2 + 1\) and thus for \(x^4 - 1\). Therefore the degree
of the splitting field is 2.</li>
<li>The roots of \(x^4 + 1\) are \(\omega, \omega^3, \omega^5, \omega^7\) where
\(\omega\) is a primitive eighth root of unity. Any field extension of \(\Q\)
that contains one of the four roots also contains the other three; therefore,
\(\Q(\omega)\) is a splitting field for \(x^4 + 1\).  We showed in
<a href="/artin/15.3">Exercise 15.3.4(c)</a> that the minimal polynomial for
\(\omega\) over \(\Q\) has degree 4, therefore \([\Q(\omega) : \Q] = 4\).</li>
</ol>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 16.3.3</span> Let \(K\) be a splitting field
for \(x^2 - u\). In \(K\), this polynomial must factor as \((x - f)(x - g)\),
so \(f + g = 0\) and \(fg = -u\), thus, \(f^2 = u\). Suppose \(f \in F\). Then
write \(f = g/h\) where \(g, h \in \mathbb{F}_2(u)\). Then \(f^2 h^2 = g^2\),
but \(f^2 = u\), so \(uh^2 = g^2\). Obviously both sides are nonzero, so their
degrees must be equal, which is a contradiction since the degree of \(uh^2\) is
odd and that of \(g^2\) is even. Our assumption that \(f \in F\) must therefore
be wrong, and \(x^2 - u\) is irreducible over \(F\). Note that since \(K\) has
characteristic 2, we have \(x^2 - u = (x + f)(x - f) = (x - f)(x - f)\), so
\(f\) is a double root.</p>
