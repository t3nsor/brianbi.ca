<h2>Section 16.2. The Discriminant</h2>
<p><span class="problem">Exercise 16.2.1</span> Suppose the variables \(u_i\)
and \(u_j\) are swapped in (16.2.1). Factors that don't contain \(u_i\) or
\(u_j\) are unaffected. Factors of the form \((u_i - u_k)^2\) and
\((u_j - u_k)^2\), where \(k \ne i, j\) transform into each other. The factor
\((u_i - u_j)^2\) becomes \((u_j - u_i)^2\), which is the same polynomial. Thus
the discriminant remains unchanged under transpositions. But the transpositions
generate all permutations.</p>

<ol class="subproblems">
<li><p>A real cubic either has three real roots or one real root.</p>
<p>If it has three real roots, the discriminant will obviously be
nonnegative.</p>
<p>If it has one real root, then its roots will be
\(r, z, \overline{z}\) where \(r\) is real and \(z\) is nonreal.
In that case, the discriminant will be \((r - z)^2(r - \overline{z})^2
(z - \overline{z})^2\). Now \(z - \overline{z}\) is pure imaginary and nonzero,
so \((z - \overline{z})^2\) is negative. The product of the other two factors
can be rewritten as \(((r - z)(r - \overline{z}))^2 =
(r^2 - r(z + \overline{z}) + z\overline{z})^2\). But \(z + \overline{z}\) and
\(z\overline{z}\) are both real, so \((r - z)^2(r - \overline{z})^2\) is
positive (it cannot be zero since neither \(r - z\) nor \(r - \overline{z}\)
can be zero). Therefore, the discriminant is the product of a negative real and
a positive real, and is therefore negative.</li>
<li><p>A real quartic has zero, two, or four real roots. Since the discriminant
is positive, all four roots are distinct.</p>
<p>Obviously, if there are four real roots, the discriminant is positive.</p>
<p>If there are two real roots, then the
roots are of the form \(r_1, r_2, z, \overline{z}\) where \(r_1, r_2\)
are real and \(z\) is nonreal. In the discriminant, as in part (a), we find
that \((z - \overline{z})^2\) is negative while \((r_i - z)^2
(r_i - \overline{z})^2\) is positive for \(i = 1, 2\). The last factor,
\((r_1 - r_2)^2\), is positive. So the discriminant in this case is
negative.</p>
<p>If the quartic has no real roots, then it has
roots of the form \(z_1, \overline{z_1}, z_2, \overline{z_2}\). The two
factors \((z_i - \overline{z_i})^2\) are each real and negative. The factors
\((z_1 - z_2)^2\) and \((\overline{z_1} - \overline{z_2})^2\) are complex
conjugates of each other so their product is real and positive. The same
goes for \((z_1 - \overline{z_2})^2\) and \((\overline{z_1} - z_2)^2\). So the
discriminant must be positive.</p>
<p>Thus, given the information that the
discriminant is positive, we can conclude that the number of real roots of the
quartic is either 0 or 4 (and that all roots are distinct).</p></li>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 16.2.3</span></p>
<ol class="subproblems">
<li>The roots of the transformed cubic will simply be shifted by \(-s_1/3\)
compared to the roots of the old cubic, so all factors in the discriminant
remain unchanged, so the discriminant remains unchanged.</li>
<li>This is trivial so I have skipped it.</li>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 16.2.4</span></p>
<ol class="subproblems">
<li><p>The coefficient \(p\) has weighted degree 2 and the coefficient \(q\)
has weighted degree 3, and the discriminant is homogeneous with degree 6. The
only nonnegative integer combinations of 2 and 3 that yield 6 are \(3\cdot 2\)
and \(2 \cdot 3\). Thus, \(\Delta = ap^3 + bq^2\) for some constants \(a, b\).
To determine the constants, we will use the polynomials \(x^3 - x\) and
\(x^3 - 3x - 2\). The former has roots \(-1, 0, 1\) so its discriminant is 4.
Therefore, \(a(-1)^3 = 4\), and \(a = -4\). The latter has a double root at
\(x = 1\), as we can determine easily using the multiple root theorem; so its
discriminant is 0. Therefore \(a(-3)^3 + b(-2)^2 = 0\), from which we obtain
\(b = -27\). Therefore, \(\Delta = -4p^3 - 27q^2\).</p></li>
<li><p>The coefficient \(p\) has weighted degree 3 and the coefficient \(q\)
has weighted degree 4, and the discriminant has degree 12. The only possible
monomials in the discriminant are therefore \(p^4\) and \(q^3\), that is,
\(\Delta = ap^4 + bq^3\). We first consider the polynomial \(x^4 - x =
x(x^3 - 1)\). Its discriminant contains six factors, three of which occur in
the discriminant of \(x^3 - 1\), which is \(-27\) according to part (a). The
remaining three factors are \((e^{2\pi ij/3})^2\) for \(j = 0, 1, 2\), that is,
\(1, \omega^2, \omega^4\), the product of which is 1. Therefore, the
discriminant of \(x^4 - x\) is \(-27\), which implies \(a = -27\). Next we
consider the polynomial \(x^4 - 4x + 3\), which has a double root at \(x = 1\).
Its discriminant is \(0 = -27(-4)^4 + b\cdot 3^3\), giving \(b = 256\). Thus,
\(\Delta = -27p^4 + 256q^3\).</p></li>
<li><p>The coefficient \(p\) has weighted degree 4 and the coefficient \(q\)
has weighted degree 5, and the discriminant has degree 20. Therefore the
discriminant equals \(ap^5 + bq^4\) for some constants \(a, b\). Part (b)
implies that the discriminant of \(x^5 - x\) is that of \(x^4 - 1\) times
\((1 \cdot i \cdot (-1) \cdot -i)^2 = 1\), that is, \(-256\). Therefore
\(a = 256\). To find \(b\), we use the polynomial \(x^5 - 5x + 4\), which has a
double root at \(x = 1\). Its discriminant is \(0 = 256(-5)^5 + b \cdot 4^4\),
from which we obtain \(b = 3125\). Therefore \(\Delta = 256p^5 +
3125q^4\).</p></li>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 16.2.5</span> Set \(u_4 = 0\) in the
discriminant to obtain \(u_1^2 u_2^2 u_3^2 D(u_1, u_2, u_3) =
s_3^2 D(u_1, u_2, u_3)\). According to (16.2.5),
\(D(u_1, u_2, u_3) = -4s_1^3 s_3 + s_1^2 s_2^2 + 18s_1 s_2 s_3 - 4s_2^3 -
27s_3^2\) where the symmetric polynomials are for the three variables \(u_1,
u_2, u_3\). Lemma 16.1.11 then implies that \(D(u_1, u_2, u_3, u_4) =
s_3^2 (-4s_1^3 s_3 + s_1^2 s_2^2 + 18s_1 s_2 s_3 - 4s_2^3 - 27s_3^2) + hs_4\)
for some symmetric polynomial \(h\).</p>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 16.2.6</span> Shifting all roots by \(t\)
doesn't change the discriminant, so \(\frac{\d\Delta}{\d t} = 0\). We
also have
\begin{align*}
\frac{\d s_1}{\d t} &amp;= \frac{\d}{\d t}(u_1 + t + u_2 + t + u_3 + t) = 3 \\
\frac{\d s_2}{\d t} &amp;= \frac{\d}{\d t}((u_1 + t)(u_2 + t) + (u_2 + t)
(u_3 + t) + (u_3 + t)(u_1 + t)) = u_1 + t + u_2 + t + u_2 + t + u_3 + t +
u_3 + t + u_1 + t = 2s_1 \\
\frac{\d s_3}{\d t} &amp;= \frac{\d}{\d t}((u_1 + t)(u_2 + t)(u_3 + t) =
(u_2 + t)(u_3 + t) + (u_3 + t)(u_1 + t) + (u_1 + t)(u_2 + t) = s_2
\end{align*}
According to (16.2.5), \(\Delta(s_1, s_2, s_3) = -4s_1^3 s_3 + s_1^2 s_2^2 +
18s_1 s_2 s_3 - 4s_2^3 - 27s_3^2\). Therefore,
\begin{align*}
\frac{\p \Delta}{\p s_1} &amp;= -12s_1^2 s_3 + 2s_1 s_2^2 + 18s_2 s_3 \\

\frac{\p \Delta}{\p s_3} &amp;= -4s_1^3 + 18s_1s_2 - 54s_3

so that

\frac{\d \Delta}{\d t}
&amp;= \frac{\p \Delta}{\p s_1}\frac{\d s_1}{\d t} +
\frac{\p \Delta}{\p s_2}\frac{\d s_2}{\d t} +

as expected.</p>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 16.2.7</span></p>
<p class="lemma">Suppose \(P \in \C[x_1, \ldots, x_n]\) is both symmetric and
<em>alternating</em> (meaning it vanishes whenever any two of the \(x\)'s are
equal). Then \(D \divides P\), where \(D\) is the discriminant
\(\prod_{i &lt; j} (x_i - x_j)^2\).</p>
<p class="proof">If \(n = 1\) then \(D = 1\) and there is nothing to prove.
Otherwise, first perform polynomial division of \(P\) by \(x_1 - x_2\) in the
variable \(x_1\), giving \(P = (x_1 - x_2)Q + R\) where \(Q, R\) depend only
on \(x_2, \ldots, x_n\). Now \((x_1 - x_2)Q\) is alternating, so \(R\) must be
alternating, but since \(R\) doesn't depend on \(x_1\), \(R\) must vanish
identically. So \(P = (x_1 - x_2)Q\). Now divide \(Q\) by \(x_1 - x_2\) in the
variable \(x_1\), giving \(P = (x_1 - x_2)^2 S + (x_1 - x_2)T\) where both
\(S\) and \(T\) depend on \(x_2, \ldots, x_n\) alone. Since \(P\) is invariant
under exchange of \(x_1, x_2\), perform this exchange to yield \(P =
(x_1 - x_2)^2 S' - (x_1 - x_2)T'\) where \(S'\) and \(T'\) are obtained by
replacing each occurrence of \(x_1\) by \(x_2\) in \(S\) and \(T\),
respectively. Adding the equations \(P = (x_1 - x_2)^2 S + (x_1 - x_2)T\) and
\(P = (x_1 - x_2)^2 S' - (x_1 - x_2)T'\), we obtain \(2P =
(x_1 - x_2)^2 (S + S') + (x_1 - x_2) (T - T')\).
But \(T - T'\) is alternating, so \(x_1 - x_2 \mid T - T'\).
Therefore, in fact, \((x_1 - x_2)^2 \mid 2P\). The above reasoning holds for
any pair of variables among \(x_1, \ldots, x_n\), therefore \((x_i - x_j)^2\)
divides \(P\) for all \(i, j\). But \(\C[x_1, \ldots, x_n]\) is a UFD and the
elements \(x_i - x_j\) are irreducible, so the factorization of \(P\) contains
at least two copies of each \(x_i - x_j\). Therefore \(D \divides P\).</p>
<p>We now return to the problem. Observe that \(q\) is obtained from
\(p\) by exchanging any pair of the \(u\)'s. Therefore, \((p - q)^2\) is
symmetric and alternating, and the Lemma implies that \(D \divides (p - q)^2\).
But \(D\) is homogeneous with degree \(n(n-1)\), and so is \((p - q)^2\),
therefore \((p - q)^2 = cD\) where \(c\) is a constant. Finally, observe that
in \(D\), the coefficient of \(u_1^2 u_2^4 \ldots u_{n-1}^{2(n-1)}\) is 1, and
the same is true of \((p - q)^2\). Therefore \((p - q)^2 = D\).</p>
