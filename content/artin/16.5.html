<li>The automorphism \(\sigma\) is an involution; the group it generates
consists of only itself and the identity. Following Example 16.5.5, let
\(K = \C(t + t^{-1})\). Clearly \(K\) is a subfield of the fixed field.
Furthermore, \(t\) is a root of the polynomial \((x - t)(x - t^{-1}) =
x^2 - (t + t^{-1})x + 1\), which has coefficients in \(K\), so the
degree \([\C(t) : K]\) is at most 2. Since \(K\) is a subfield of the fixed
field and the fixed field has degree 2 (by the Fixed Field Theorem), \(K\)
itself is the fixed field.</li>
<li>The orbit of \(t\) under \(\sigma\) is \(t, it, -t, -it, t, \ldots\), so
\(\sigma\) generates a cyclic group of order 4. Let \(K = \C(t^4)\). Clearly
the degree \([\C(t) : K]\) is at most 4, and \(K\) is a subfield of the fixed
field, over which \(\C(t)\) has degree 4.
Therefore \(K\) is itself the fixed field. </li>
<li>Both \(\sigma\) and \(\tau\) are involutions, so the automorphism group is
the Klein four-group. We claim that
the fixed field is \(K = \C(t^2 + t^{-2})\). This follows from the fact that
\(K\) is fixed by both \(\sigma\) and \(\tau\) and that \(t\) is a root of the
polynomial \(x^4 - (t^2 + t^{-2})x^2 + 1\), so \([\C(t) : K]\) is at most
4.</li>
<li>\(\sigma\) has order 3 and \(\tau\) has order 2, with \(\sigma(\tau(t)) =
\omega^{-1} t^{-1} = \omega^2 t^{-1} = \tau(\sigma^2(t))\). Therefore the
automorphism group is the symmetric group \(S_3\) and the degree of
\(\C(t)\) over the fixed field is 6. By similar reasoning to part (c), we find
that the fixed field is \(\C(t^3 + t^{-3})\).</li>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 16.5.3</span> Since \(\C\) is algebraically
closed, any element of an extension field of \(\C\) that is not in \(\C\) is
automatically transcendental over \(\C\). Explicitly, suppose \(u \in \C(t)\)
and \(u\) is algebraic over \(\C\). Then \(g(u) = 0\) for some monic polynomial
\(g \in \C[z]\). By the fundamental theorem of calculus, we can write
\(g(z) = (z - z_1) \ldots (z - z_n)\) where \(n = \deg g\) and \(z_i \in \C\)
for each \(i\). Since \(g(u) = 0\), this implies \(u = z_i\) for some \(i\),
therefore \(u \in \C\).</p>
