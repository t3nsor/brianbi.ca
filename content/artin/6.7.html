<h2>Section 6.7. Abstract Symmetry: Group Operations</h2>
<p><span class="problem">Exercise 6.7.1</span></p>
<ol class="subproblems">
<li>\(D_4\) consists of the identity, three non-identity rotations, two
reflections across diagonals, and two reflections across lines parallel to two
sides. By inspection, the stabilizer of a vertex consists only of the identity
and the single reflection across the diagonal that contains that point, and
the stabilizer of an edge consists only of the identity and the single
reflection across a line perpendicular to that edge.</li>
<li>By inspection, the stabilizer consists of the identity operation, the
180 degree rotation, and the reflections across the two diagonals.</li>
</ol>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 6.7.2</span> Pick some point \(P\) on
\(\ell\) arbitrarily. Every plane isometry can then be uniquely written in
the form \(m = t_a \rho_\theta r^k\) where \(k\) is 0 or 1, the rotation is
considered to be around the point \(P\), and the reflection is considered to be
across the line \(\ell\). Since \(r^k\) itself stabilizes \(\ell\) for either
choice of \(k\), the orientation-preserving part \(t_a\rho_\theta\) must also
stabilize \(\ell\) for \(m\) to stabilize \(\ell\) overall. In the
orientation-preserving part, the rotation must be through an angle of either
0 or \(\pi\), otherwise it would change the line's slope. Since \(P\) lies on
\(\ell\), either \(\rho_0\) or \(\rho_\pi\) itself stabilizes \(\ell\), so
the translation part must stabilize \(\ell\) also. We therefore conclude that
the stabilizer of \(\ell\) is \(\{t_a \rho_{i\pi} r^k \mid a \parallel \ell,
i \in \{0, 1\}, k \in \{0, 1\}\}\).</p>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 6.7.3</span></p>
<ol class="subproblems">
<li>The action of \(S_3\) on \(U\) is a homomorphism \(S_3 \to S_3\) since
\(|U| = 3\). The kernel of this homomorphism can only be the trivial group or
the normal subgroup \(A_3\). In the latter case the image would have order 2
so it would have to consist of the identity and a transposition, and the
element not involved in the transposition would be a fixed point. We are told
that the action on \(U\) is transitive, so this latter possibility is ruled
out. The action of \(S_3\) on \(U\) is therefore an automorphism \(S_3 \to
S_3\) that maps the three transpositions \((1\ 2), (2\ 3), (3\ 1)\) to three
different transpositions of \(U\). Label the elements of \(U\) fixed by these
three transpositions, respectively, as \(u_3, u_2, u_1\). Then each
transposition \(\tau \in S_3\) acts by sending \(u_i\) to \(u_{\tau(i)}\) for
each \(i\), and since the transpositions generate \(S_3\), the same is true for
general permutations \(\sigma \in S_3\). We can use
the action of \(S_3\) on \(V\) to label the elements of \(V\) in the same
manner. The diagonal action of \(\sigma\) on \(U \times V\) therefore maps
\((u_i, v_j)\) to \((u_{\sigma(i)}, v_{\sigma(j)})\). If \(i = j\), the orbit
therefore consists of the three elements \((u_1, v_1), (u_2, v_2),
(u_3, v_3)\). On the other hand, if \(i \neq j\) and \(i' \neq j'\), then
we can always find a permutation \(\sigma\) with \(\sigma(i) = i',
\sigma(j) = j'\), which would therefore map \((u_i, v_j)\) to
\((u_{i'}, v_{j'})\). This implies that the other 6 elements of \(U \times
V\), that is, the elements of the form \((u_i, v_j)\) with \(i \neq j\), form
a single orbit.</li>
<li>Label the elements of \(U\) as in part (a). The action of \(S_3\) on
\(V\) is a homomorphism \(S_3 \to G\) where \(G\) is a subgroup of \(S_3\) that
fixes the index 1 and does not fix 2 and 3; \(G\) can only be \(\{1,
\tau_{23}\}\). Since \(G\) has order 2, the kernel of this homomorphism is
\(A_3\), and therefore even permutations of \(S_3\) act as the identity on
\(V\) while odd permutations interchange \(v_2\) and \(v_3\). Obviously the
orbit of \((u_i, v_1)\) under the diagonal action can only contain elements of
the form \((u_j, v_1)\), and
since \(S_3\) acts transitively on \(U\), one of the orbits is \(U \times
\{v_1\}\). On the other hand, suppose \(i, i' \in \{1, 2, 3\}\) and
\(j, j' \in \{2, 3\}\). Then we can always find \(\sigma \in S_3\) with
\(\sigma(u_i, v_j) = (u_{i'}, v_{j'})\), since there are two permutations
sending \(i\) to \(i'\) of different parities and we choose the even or odd
one depending on whether \(j\) and \(j'\) are equal or unequal. Therefore the
other 6 elements \(\{(u, v) \mid u \in U, v \in V \setminus \{v_1\}\}\) form
a single orbit.</li>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 6.7.5</span> Assume the cube is positioned so
that each of its faces is parallel to one of the coordinate planes.</p>
<p>There are 24 orientation-preserving symmetries of the cube, which can be
described as follows:
<ul>
<li>the identity operation,</li>
<li>4 rotations through each of the angles \(2\pi/3\) and \(4\pi/3\), taken
around body diagonals, for a total of 8 operations,</li>
<li>3 rotations through each of the angles \(\pi/2, \pi, 3\pi/2\), taken
around the coordinate axes, for a total of 9 operations,</li>
<li>6 rotations through the angle \(\pi\), taken around the lines joining
midpoints of opposite edges, for a total of 6 operations.</li>
</ul>
<p>We know that these \(1 + 9 + 8 + 6 = 24\) symmetries
are distinct since two rotations around different axes are different rotations,
as are two rotations around the same axis with different angles. So we have
described all 24 orientation-preserving symmetries.</p>
<p>The 24 orientation-reversing symmetries can be classified as:</p>
<ul>
<li>reflections across the (3) coordinate planes and across the (6) planes that
contain corresponding face diagonals on opposite faces, for a total of 9
operations,</li>
<li>the inversion operation,</li>
<li>8 rotoreflections consisting of a reflection across a plane perpendicular
to a body diagonal followed by a rotation through angle \(\pi/6\) or \(5\pi/6\)
around that body diagonal, and 6 rotoreflections consisting of a reflection
across a coordinate plane followed by a rotation through angle \(\pi/2\) or
\(3\pi/2\) around the perpendicular axis, for a total of 14 operations.</li>
</ul>
<p>We argue that these \(9 + 1 + 14 = 24\) orientation-reversing
symmetries are distinct (and therefore account for all the
orientation-reversing symmetries) as follows. A reflection fixes all points on
the plane of reflection, while the inversion and rotoreflection operations have
only a single fixed point at the origin. An inversion has the entirety of
\(\mathbb{R}^3\) as an eigenspace, while a rotoreflection where the angle of
rotation is neither 0 nor \(\pi\) has only a single
eigenvector, which is parallel to the axis. So the three categories in the
list above are disjoint. Two reflections in different planes are distinct, so
there are indeed 9 reflections among the symmetries of the cube.
Two rotoreflections with different axes are also distinct since they have
different eigenvectors, as are two rotoreflections with the same axis and
different angles. So there are indeed 14 rotoreflections among the symmetries
of the cube.</p>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 6.7.6</span> Assume the prism is placed so
that its centroid lies at the origin and the triangular faces are parallel to
the xy plane.</p>

<p>Consider first the
orientation-preserving symmetries, which consist of the identity operation and
pure rotations. A rotation that is a symmetry of the prism must stabilize the
z-axis, since the latter is determined by the centroids of the two triangular
faces. The rotation must therefore have \(\hat{z}\) as an eigenvector.
There are two cases:</p>
<ol>
<li>The eigenvalue of \(\hat{z}\) is \(+1\). This implies that the rotation is
around the z-axis itself. If it is not the identity, then it must be by 120
or 240 degrees.</li>
<li>The eigenvalue of \(\hat{z}\) is \(-1\). This implies that:
<ul>
<li>the angle of rotation is 180 degrees;</li>
<li>the axis of rotation is perpendicular to the z-axis;</li>
<li>the two rays that constitute the z-axis are exchanged by the rotation, and
therefore so are the two triangular faces.</li>
</ul>
In order for such a rotation to map a vertex of the prism to another vertex
(which, as stated, will be on the opposite triangular face), the axis of
rotation must contain the midpoint of the two vertices. By considering the
three possible target vertices of a single vertex under such a rotation, we
see that the axis must pass through the centroid of one of the rectangular
faces; and a rotation of 180 degrees around either of these three axes is
a symmetry of the prism. So there are 3 rotational symmetries in this
category.</li>
</ol>
<p>This makes a total of 6 orientation-preserving symmetries of the triangular
prism. The prism also has at least one plane of symmetry, such as the plane
parallel to and equidistant from the two triangular faces; let \(r\) denote the
reflection across this plane. Then the map \(g \mapsto rg\) is a bijection
between orientation-preserving symmetries to orientation-reversing symmetries,
so there are also exactly 6 orientation-reversing symmetries, for a total of
12. A rectangular face is stabilized by 4 of these symmetries: the identity,
the rotation around an axis that passes through its centroid, and the
composition of \(r\) with these two symmetries.</p>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 6.7.7</span></p>
<ol>
<li>Obviously one orbit consists of
the zero vector alone. We claim that all other vectors lie in a single orbit.
To see this, first observe that all \(n\) standard basis vectors lie in a
single orbit (they are mapped to each other by permutation matrices). Now
let \(v \in \mathbb{R}^n \setminus \{0\}\). Pick \(i\) such that \(v_i
\neq 0\). Then \(v = Av'\) where \(v' = 1\) and \(A\) is an elementary matrix
of the third kind that scales entry \(i\) by the factor \(v_i\). And
\(v'\) can be written as a product of elementary matrices of the first kind
and \(e_i\) where each elementary matrix of the first kind is used to add
a multiple of element \(i\) to one of the other elements. Since all elementary
matrices are invertible, this establishes that every nonzero vector lies in
the orbit of some standard basis vector, and since all standard basis vectors
lie in a single orbit as well, this implies that all nonzero vectors form a
single orbit.</li>
<li>\(Me_1 = e_1\) if and only if the first column of \(M\) is \(e_1\). The
stabilizer of \(e_1\) therefore consists of all invertible matrices that have
\(e_1\) as their first column. Using expansion by minors, we can characterize
this set as the set of \(n \times n\) matrices with \(e_1\) as their first
column, arbitrary elements in the other entries in the first row, and an
invertible matrix for the remaining \((n-1) \times (n - 1)\) entries.</li>
</ol>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 6.7.8</span></p>
<ol class="subproblems">
<li>If \(A, B\) are invertible, then they lie in the same orbit, since
\(A = (AB^{-1})B\) and \(AB^{-1} \in GL_2(\mathbb{C})\). It is also clear that
an invertible matrix is not in the same orbit as any singular matrix. So one
orbit consists of precisely the invertible matrices. The zero matrix also forms
its own orbit. The remaining matrices in \(\mathbb{C}^{2\times 2}\) have
rank 1 and we claim that the matrices
\[
A_x = \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; x \\ 0 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix},
\qquad
B = \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix},
\]
all belong to different orbits and that these orbits exhaust the matrices of
rank 1. To see this, observe that
\[
\begin{pmatrix} a &amp; b \\ c &amp; d \end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix} e &amp; f \\ 0 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix}
= \begin{pmatrix} ae &amp; af \\ ce &amp; cf \end{pmatrix}
\]
so left-multiplication won't change the ratio of the entries in the first row.
Furthermore an arbitrary rank 1 matrix can be row-reduced to the form
\(A_x\) or \(B\) as follows. If the first column of \(M\) vanishes, the second
column must not vanish; the rows can be swapped if needed to make the top-right
entry nonzero, then the first row can be scaled to make the top-right entry 1,
and a multiple of the first row can be added to the second row to zero out the
lower-right entry, resulting in matrix \(B\). Performing elementary row
operations is equivalent to left-multiplying by an invertible matrix, so \(M\)
lies in the same orbit as \(B\). If on the other hand the first column of
\(M\) doesn't vanish, then we can swap the rows as need to make the top-left
entry nonzero, then scale the first row to make the top-left entry equal to 1,
then add a multiple of the first row to the second row to zero out the
bottom-left entry. These elementary row operations don't change the rank of
the matrix, so the resulting matrix must have 0 in its bottom-right entry in
order to still have rank 1. Therefore the resulting matrix is some \(A_x\),
and \(M\) and \(A_x\) lie in the same orbit.</li>
<li>According to the Jordan normal form theorem, there is one orbit for each
Jordan form up to permutation of the blocks. Therefore, there is a separate
orbit for every pair of <em>distinct</em> complex numbers \(\lambda_1,
\lambda_2\), with \(\diag(\lambda_1, \lambda_2)\) as a representative, and
for every complex number \(\lambda\) there are additionally two distinct
orbits: one with \(\lambda I\) as a representative, and one whose
representative is \(\lambda I\) plus a 1 in the upper-right corner.</li>
</ol>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 6.7.9</span></p>
<ol class="subproblems">
<li>The identity element of \(G\) is \((I, I)\), and \((I, I) * A = IAI^{-1}
= A\). Also, \(((P_1, Q_1)(P_2, Q_2))A = (P_1 P_2)A(Q_1 Q_2)^{-1} =
P_1 P_2 A Q_2^{-1} Q_1^{-1} = P_1(P_2 A Q_2^{-1}) Q_1^{-1} =
(P_1, Q_1) * ((P_2, Q_2) * A)\). So \(*\) is a valid group action.</li>
<li>The action of \(G\) allows us to multiply by any invertible matrix on
either the left or right, therefore the orbit of a matrix consists of those
matrices that can be reached by any sequence of elementary row operations
and elementary column operations, in any order; left-multiplication performs
row operations while right-multiplication performs column operations. Each
matrix of rank \(r\) can be converted to reduced row echelon form with
\(r\) leading coefficients and then column operations can be used to move
each leading coefficient onto the diagonal and clear all remaining entries.
Thus every \(m \times n\) matrix of rank \(r\) lies in the same orbit as the
matrix that has \(1\) for the first \(r\) entries of the diagonal and 0 at all
other entries. This, together with the fact that row and column operations
preserve rank, implies that there is one orbit of \(*\) for each possible rank
\(r = 0, 1, \ldots, \min(m, n)\).</li>
<li>Write \(Q\) in block form
\[
Q = \left[\begin{array}{c|c}
A &amp; B \\ \hline
C &amp; D
\end{array}\right]
\]
where \(A\) is an \(m \times m\) matrix, \(B\) is an \(m \times (n - m)\)
matrix, \(C\) is an \(m \times (n - m)\) matrix, and \(D\) is an \((n - m)
\times (n - m)\) matrix.
We want to find \(P, Q\) such that
\[
P \left[\begin{array}{c|c} I &amp; 0\end{array}\right]
\left[\begin{array}{c|c}
A &amp; B \\ \hline
C &amp; D
\end{array}\right]^{-1} = 
\left[\begin{array}{c|c} I &amp; 0\end{array}\right]
\]
Multiply both sides on the right by \(Q\) to obtain
\[\left[\begin{array}{c|c} P &amp; 0\end{array}\right] =
\left[\begin{array}{c|c} I &amp; 0\end{array}\right]
\left[\begin{array}{c|c}
A &amp; B \\ \hline
C &amp; D
\end{array}\right]
\]
therefore \(P = A\) and \(B = 0\). The stabilizer therefore consists of pairs
of an invertible \(m \times m\) matrix \(P\) and an \(n \times n\) matrix of
the form
\[
Q = \left[\begin{array}{c|c}
P &amp; 0 \\ \hline
C &amp; D
\end{array}\right]
\]
where \(C\) is an arbitrary \((n - m) \times m\) matrix and, in order for
\(Q\) to be invertible, \(D\) is an invertible but otherwise arbitrary
\((n - m) \times (n - m)\) matrix.</li>
</ol>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 6.7.10</span></p>
<ol class="subproblems">
<li>According to the Jordan normal form theorem, the orbit consists of those
matrices that have the given matrix as their Jordan normal form, namely, those
whose eigenvalues are 1 and 2. As for the stabilizer, consider conjugation by
some matrix \(M\) with determinant \(\Delta \neq 0\),
\begin{align*}
M\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 2 \end{pmatrix} M^{-1}
&amp;= \frac{1}{\Delta}
\begin{pmatrix} a &amp; b \\ c &amp; d \end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 2 \end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix} d &amp; -b \\ -c &amp; a \end{pmatrix} \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{\Delta}
\begin{pmatrix} ad - 2bc &amp; ab \\ -cd &amp; 2ad-bc \end{pmatrix} \\
&amp;= 
\begin{pmatrix} 1 - \frac{bc}{\Delta} &amp; \frac{ab}{\Delta} \\
-\frac{cd}{\Delta} &amp; 1 + \frac{ad}{\Delta} \end{pmatrix}
\end{align*}
so in order to get the original matrix back we must have \(bc = ab = cd = 0,
ad = \Delta\). That is, the stabilizer consists of the invertible diagonal
matrices.</li>
<li>This is fairly straightforward to do using the counting formula. The
order of \(GL_2(\mathbb{F}_5)\) is 480: the first column can be one of 24
nonzero vectors, and each choice excludes 5 possible choices for the vector in
the second column, namely those that are multiples of the first column, leaving
20.  According to part (a), the stabilizer consists of the 16 invertible
diagonal matrices. (Note that the argument for the form of the stabilizer did
not depend on the Jordan normal form theorem, which only holds in algebraically
closed fields.)  So the order of the orbit is \(480 \div 16 = 30\). I'm not
sure how Artin expects us to do the problem without using the counting formula
(which is not introduced until section 9), though.</li>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 6.7.11</span> According to
<a href="/artin/2.8">Exercise 2.8.10</a>, any subgroup \(G\) of order 12 of
\(S_4\) must be normal, therefore it must be the kernel of some homomorphism
\(\varphi : S_4 \to H\) where \(H\) is a group of order 2 and therefore has
the form \(\{+1, -1\}\). Let \(\sigma\) be a 3-cycle in \(S_4\). Then
\(+1 = \varphi(1) = \varphi(\sigma^3) = \varphi(\sigma)^3\), so
\(\varphi(\sigma) = +1\). But according to
<a href="/artin/2.4">Exercise 2.4.11(b)</a>, the 3-cycles generate \(A_4\).
Therefore every even permutation in \(S_4\) is mapped to \(+1\); that is,
\(A_4 \subseteq G\). But \(A_4\) has order 12, so \(G = A_4\).</p>
