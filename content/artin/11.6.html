<h2>Section 11.6. Product Rings</h2>
<p><span class="problem">Exercise 11.6.1</span> It is clear that
\(\varphi(f) = (f(1), f(i))\). So \(\ker f\) is the set of real polynomials
such that \(f(1) = f(i) = 0\), which is the ideal \((x - 1) \cap (x^2 + 1)\).
Since these two polynomials have no common factors, this ideal is equivalently
generated by the single element \((x - 1)(x^2 + 1) = x^3 - x^2 + x - 1\). The
image of \(\varphi\) is obviously contained in \(\R \times \C\), since
\(f(1) \in \R\) for all \(f \in \R[x]\). Suppose \(a \in \R, b \in \C\). Let
\(f(x) = (a/2) (x^2 + 1) + (x - 1) (\Re(z) + x \Im(z))\) where
\(z = b/(i - 1)\).  Then \(f(1) = a\) and \(f(i) = b\), and \(f\) has real
coefficients, so indeed \(\im \varphi = \R \times \C\).</p>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 11.6.2</span> The ring \(\Z/(6)\) is
isomorphic to \(\Z/(3) \times \Z/(2)\) and we can prove it using Proposition
11.6.2. Let \(e = 3\); then \(e\) is idempotent in \(\Z/(6)\). Let \(e' =
1 - e = -2\); we then have \(\Z/(6) \cong (\Z/(6))/(3) \times
(\Z/(6))/(-2) \cong \Z/(3) \times \Z/(2)\).</p>
<p>The ring \(\Z/(8)\) is not isomorphic to \(\Z/(2) \times \Z/(4)\). One way
to see this is to note that 0 and 1 are the only idempotent elements of
\(\Z/(8)\). Another way is to observe that in \(Z/(8)\) there are elements
satisfying \(x^2 \ne 0, x^3 = 0\), namely 2 and 6, but there are no such
elements in \(\Z/(2) \times \Z/(4)\).</p>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 11.6.3</span> Let \(R\) be a ring of order
10. The group \(R^+\) is abelian and has order 10, so it must be isomorphic to
\(C_{10}\). Thus, \(R\) has characteristic 10, and each element of \(R\) is
of the form \(1 + \ldots + 1\). Thus, \(R \cong \Z/10\Z\).</p>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 11.6.4</span> By Proposition 11.5.5(a), all
of these rings consist of the four elements \(0, 1, \alpha, \alpha + 1\).</p>
<ol class="subproblems">
<li>Let \(R\) denote the specified ring. Here \(\alpha(\alpha + 1) =
\alpha^2 + \alpha = -1 = 1\), so the elements
\(\alpha\) and \(\alpha + 1\) are inverses, so all nonzero elements of \(R\)
have an inverse; thus, \(R\) is a finite field of order 4. (We could also see
that this
is the case using the fact that \(\alpha^2 + \alpha + 1\) is
irreducible over \(\Z/2\Z\).)</li>
<li>Let \(R\) denote the specified ring. Unlike in case (a), the element
\(\alpha + 1\) has no inverse, so \(R\) isn't a field; furthermore, 0 and 1
are the only idempotent elements of \(R\), so \(R\) isn't a nontrivial internal
direct product either. The best we can do is observe that \(R\) is isomorphic
to a ring with a slightly simpler definition:  \(R = (\Z/2\Z)[x]/
(x^2 + 1) \cong (\Z/2\Z)[y]/(y^2)\) where \(y = x + 1\).</li>
<li>Let \(R\) denote the specified ring. The element \(\alpha\) is idempotent
in \(R\); by Proposition 11.6.2, \(R \cong \alpha R \times (1 - \alpha)R
\cong \Z/2\Z \times \Z/2\Z\).</li>
</ol>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 11.6.5</span> Let \(R\) denote the
specified ring, \(R = \R[x]/(x^2 - 1)\), with \(\alpha\) being the residue of
\(x\). Let \(e = \frac{1}{2}(1 + \alpha)\) and \(e' =
\frac{1}{2}(1 - \alpha)\).  By Proposition 11.5.5(a), the elements
\(1, \alpha\) form a basis
of \(R\). The element \(r_0 + r_1 \alpha\) can be written in the form
\(ce + c'e'\), with \(c, c' \in \R\) in exactly one way, namely
\(r_0 + r_1 \alpha = (r_0 + r_1)e + (r_0 - r_1)e'\). Finally, it is easy to
verify that \(e^2 = e, e'^2 = e', ee' = 0\), so \(R \cong \R \times \R\) when
we identify \(ce + c'e'\) with \((c, c')\).</p>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 11.6.6</span> The ring we want to describe is
given by the quotient \(\R^2[x]/I\) where \(I\) is the principal ideal
generated by \((2, 0)x - (1, 1)\). Multiplying by \((0, 1)\), we see that this
ideal contains the element \((0, 1)\). Let us consider the map \(\pi :
\R^2[x] \to \R^2[x]/((0, 1))\). By the Correspondence Theorem, we have
\(\R^2[x]/I \cong \R^2[x]/((0, 1))/\pi(I)\). But quotienting out \((0, 1)\)
from \(\R^2[x]\) gives a ring isomorphic to \(\R[x]\), by taking only the first
element from each coefficient, in which the residue of \((2, 0)x - (1, 1)\) is
then \(2x - 1\). So \(\R^2[x]/I \cong \R[x]/(2x - 1) = \R[1/2]\).</p>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 11.6.7</span> In \(\Z[x]\), a polynomial is
divisible by \(2x\) if and only if it is divisible by both \(2\) and \(x\), so
it is clear that \((2x) = (2) \cap (x)\).</p>
<p>Consider the natural projection maps \(\pi_2 : \Z[x] \to \Z[x]/(2)\) and
\(\pi_x : \Z[x] \to \Z[x]/(x)\). They can be equivalently viewed as maps from
\(\Z[x]\) to \(\mathbb{F}_2[x]\) and \(\Z\), where \(\pi_x\) acts by the
substitution \(x \leftarrow 0\). The product map \(\varphi :
\Z[x] \to \mathbb{F}_2[x] \times \Z\) given by \(\varphi(f) = (\pi_2(f),
\pi_x(f))\) is also a homomorphism. Evidently \(\ker \varphi = (2) \cap (x)
= (2x)\). Note that \(\pi_2(f)(0) = \pi_2(f(0))\) for each \(f\), so whenever
\((\overline{f}, n) \in \im \varphi\), we have that \(\overline{f}(0) \equiv
n \pmod 2\). Furthermore, each \((\overline{f}, n)\) of this form is the image
of some \(f\), constructed by changing the constant term of \(\overline{f}\) to
\(n\). So \(\im \varphi\) consists of exactly those pairs \((\overline{f}, n)\)
with \(f(0) \equiv n \pmod 2\). By the first isomorphism theorem, this subring
of \(\mathbb{F}_2[x] \times \Z\) is isomorphic to \(\Z[x]/(2x)\).</p>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 11.6.8</span></p>
<ol class="subproblems">
<li>From <a href="/artin/11.3">Exercise 11.3.13</a> we know that \(IJ \subseteq
I \cap J\), so we only need to prove that \(I \cap J \subseteq IJ\). Since
\(I + J = R\), write \(1 = i + j\) where \(i \in I, j \in J\). Let \(x \in
I \cap J\). Write \(x = 1x = (i + j)x = ix + xj\). Since \(x \in J\) and
\(x \in I\), it follows that \(ix + xj \in IJ\), so \(x \in IJ\).
<div class="qed"></div></li>
<li>Write \(a - b = j - i\) where \(i \in I, j \in J\) (we can always do this
simply by taking \(a - b = i' + j'\) and letting \(i = -i', j = j'\)). Obtain
the desired solution by setting \(x = a + i = b + j\).
<div class="qed"></div></li>
<li><p>Let \(\pi_I : R \to R/I\) and \(\pi_J : R \to R/J\) be the canonical
projection maps. The product map \(\varphi : R \to (R/I) \times (R/J)\) is then
clearly a homomorphism. We must show that \(\varphi\) is surjective and
injective.</p>
<p>Let \(y \in R/I\) and \(z \in R/J\) be given; they are respectively additive
cosets
\(a + I\) and \(b + J\) for some \(a, b \in R\). By part (b), there is some
\(x \in R\) such that \(x \in a + I\) and \(x \in b + J\). Therefore
\(\varphi(x) = (y, z)\). This establishes that \(\varphi\) is surjective.</p>
<p>Now suppose \(\varphi(x) = (0, 0)\). Then \(x \in I\) and \(x \in J\), that
is, \(x \in I \cap J = IJ\). So \(x = 0\). This establishes that \(\varphi\) is
injective. So \(\varphi\) is an isomorphism.</p>
<div class="qed"></div></li>
<li><p>By part (b), there is an element \(e \in R\) such that \(e \equiv 1
\pmod I\) and \(e \equiv 0 \pmod J\), and as we argued in part (c), this
element is unique when \(IJ = 0\). Since \(e^2 \equiv 1 \pmod I\) and
\(e^2 \equiv 0 \pmod J\) as well, it follows that \(e = e^2\), so \(e\) is one
of the idempotent elements we are looking for. The other is \(e' = 1 - e\),
which satisfies \(e' \equiv 0 \pmod I\) and \(e' \equiv 1 \pmod J\) and is
similarly seen to be idempotent.<p>
<p>Let \(x \in R\) and write \(x = i + j = i' + j'\) with \(i, i' \in I,
j, j' \in J\). Then \(i - i' = j' - j\), and since \(I \cap J = IJ = 0\), this
implies \(i - i' = j' - j = 0\). So each \(x \in R\) has a unique
decomposition.</p>
<p>If \(x \in I\), so that \(x = i + 0\), then \(x \equiv 0
\pmod I\) and \(x \equiv i \pmod J\), so that \(ex \equiv 0 \pmod I\) and
\(ex \equiv 0 \pmod J\), implying \(ex = 0\). Conversely, if \(x = i + j\) and
\(ex = 0\), then we have \(x \equiv j \pmod I\), so that \(ex \equiv j \pmod
I\), so \(j \in I\), so \(j = 0\), so \(x \in I\). This establishes that the
kernel of the map \(x \mapsto ex\) is \(I\), so one of the factor rings is
isomorphic to \(R/I\). Analogously we can show that the kernel of the map
\(x \mapsto e'x\) is \(J\), so the other factor ring is isomorphic to
\(R/J\).</p></li>
