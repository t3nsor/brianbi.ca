<h2>Section 2.6. Isomorphisms</h2>
<p><span class="problem">Exercise 2.6.2</span> The homomorphism \(\varphi\) is
completely determined by the image of 1, since 1 generates the domain. If
\(\varphi(1) = 0\), then \(\varphi\) is neither surjective nor injective. If
\(\varphi(1) = \pm 1\), then \(\varphi(n) = \pm n\), and \(\varphi\) is both
surjective and injective (hence, an isomorphism). If \(\varphi(1) = k\) where
\(k \neq \pm 1\), then \(\varphi(n) = kn\) and \(\varphi\) is injective, but
not surjective as 1 is not in the image.</p>
<p><span class="problem">Exercise 2.6.4</span> \(ba = b(ab)b^{-1}\), the
conjugate of \(ab\) by \(b\).</p><div class="qed"></div>
<p><span class="problem">Exercise 2.6.5</span> The eigenvalues of \(B\) are
2 and 3. Since \(B\) is a 2&times;2 matrix, the multiplicity of each eigenvalue
is exactly 1, therefore \(A\) is the Jordan form of \(B\) (up to the order of
diagonal elements). Therefore \(A\) and \(B\) are similar, which is the same
as saying that they are conjugate in \(GL_2(\mathbb{R})\).</p>
<p><span class="problem">Exercise 2.6.6</span> Denote the two given matrices
by \(A, B\). They are conjugate by the matrix \(\begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 \\
1 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix}\), so they are conjugates in \(GL_2(\mathbb{R})\).
In general, \(M = \begin{pmatrix} p &amp; q \\
r &amp; s \end{pmatrix}\), then solving the equation \(BM = MA\) yields the
constraints \(p = 0, q = r\), implying \(\det M = -q^2\), which is not
possible when \(\det M = 1\) and \(q\) is real. Therefore \(A\) and \(B\) are
not conjugate elements in \(SL_2(\mathbb{R})\).</p>
<p><span class="problem">Exercise 2.6.7</span> Since \(1 \in H\), it follows
that \(g(1)g^{-1} = 1\) is in \(gHg^{-1}\). For all \(k \in gHg^{-1}\), there
eixsts some \(h \in H\) with \(k = ghg^{-1}\), whence \(k^{-1} =
gh^{-1}g^{-1}\), which lies in \(gHg^{-1}\) since \(h^{-1} \in H\). Finally,
for all \(k_1, k_2 \in gHg^{-1}\), there exist some \(h_1, h_2 \in H\) with
\(k_1 = gh_1 g^{-1}, k_2 = gh_2 g^{-1}\), implying \(k_1 k_2 =
gh_1 g^{-1} g h_2g^{-1} = g(h_1 h_2)g^{-1} \in gHg^{-1}\) since
\(h_1 h_2 \in H\). Therefore \(gHg^{-1}\) is a subgroup of \(G\).</p>
<p><span class="problem">Exercise 2.6.8</span> For all
\(A, B \in GL_n(\mathbb{R})\), we have \(\varphi(AB) = ((AB)^t)^{-1} =
(B^t A^t)^{-1} = (A^t)^{-1} (B^t)^{-1} = \varphi(A)\varphi(B)\). Therefore
\(\varphi\) is an endomorphism of \(GL_n(\mathbb{R})\). It is easy to see that
the kernel of \(\varphi\) is trivial, making \(\varphi\) an automorphism.</p>
<p><span class="problem">Exercise 2.6.9</span> We claim that the map
\(\varphi\) from \(G\) to \(G^\circ\) given by \(\varphi(g) = g^{-1}\) is an
isomorphism. (We established in
<a href="/artin/2.2">Exercise 2.2.6</a> that \(G^\circ\) is indeed a group.)
Let \(a, b \in G\). Then
\(\varphi(ab) = (ab)^{-1} = b^{-1} a^{-1} = a^{-1} * b^{-1} = \varphi(a) *
\varphi(b)\).  Therefore \(\varphi\) is a homomorphism. Its kernel is trivial,
so it is an isomorphism.</p>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 2.6.10</span></p>
<ol class="subproblems">
<li>Let \(\varphi : C_{10} \to C_{10}\) be an automorphism. Since \(C_{10}\) is
cyclic, the homomorphism \(\varphi\) is entirely determined by \(\varphi(1)\),
since \(\varphi(2) = \varphi(1) + \varphi(1)\) and so on; in general, every
valid endomorphism must take the form \(\varphi(n) = kn\). For such
\(\varphi\), we have  \(\varphi(a+b) = k(a+b) = ka + kb =
\varphi(a) + \varphi(b)\) for all \(a, b\), so \(\varphi\) preserves the group
operation. Therefore the set of such \(\varphi\) is exactly the set of
endomorphisms of \(C_{10}\). Note that \(\varphi\) can only take on values that
are divisible by \(\gcd(k, 10)\), so \(k\) must be congruent to 1, 3, 7, or 9
in order for \(\varphi\) to be an automorphism. As proven in
<a href="/artin/2.4">the solution to Exercise 2.4.6</a>, the elements 1, 3, 7,
and 9 generate \(C_{10}\), so \(\varphi(n) = kn\) for \(k \in \{1, 3, 7, 9\}\)
maps a generator to a generator, implying that it is surjective, and hence, in
this case, also injective, therefore an automorphism. Therefore, the
automorphisms of \(C_{10}\) are \(n \mapsto n, n \mapsto 3n, n \mapsto 7n\),
and \(n \mapsto 9n\).</li>
<li><p>An endomorphism \(\varphi : S_3 \to S_3\) is completely determined by
the images of the generators \(x, y\); there will be exactly one valid
extension to all of \(S_3\) provided that \(\varphi(x)\) and \(\varphi(y)\) are
chosen so that
\begin{equation}
\varphi(y)\varphi(x) = \varphi(x)^2 \varphi(y) \label{eqn:e2}
\end{equation}
that is, \(\varphi\) also preserves the defining relation of \(S_3\).
If \(\varphi\) is additionally
an automorphism, it must preserve the orders of elements. Referring to the
table from <a href="/artin/2.2">Exercise 2.2.1</a>, we see that \(x\) and
\(x^2\) have order 3 while \(x^j y\) has order 2 for \(j \in \{0, 1, 2\}\).
Therefore each valid automorphism must take the form \(\varphi_{ij}\) which
satisfies \(\varphi_{ij}(x) = x^i, \varphi_{ij}(y) = x^j y\), with
\(i \in \{1, 2\}\) and \(j \in \{0, 1, 2\}\). Then
\begin{align}
\varphi(y)\varphi(x) &amp;= x^j y x^i \label{eqn:e1} \\
\varphi(x)^2\varphi(y) &amp;= x^{2i} x^j y
\end{align}
Since \(yx = x^2 y\), we can move the \(y\) factor \(i\) positions to the right
in \((\ref{eqn:e1})\) to obtain \(\varphi(y)\varphi(x) = x^{2i+j} y\);
therefore \((\ref{eqn:e2})\) is always satisfied, so the 6 different possible
maps \(\varphi_{ij}\) are all valid endomorphisms of \(S_3\).</p>
<p>The general formula for \(\varphi_{ij}\) is, of course,
\begin{equation}
\varphi_{ij}(x^m y^n) = \varphi_{ij}(x^m) \varphi_{ij}(y^n) = x^{im} (x^j y)^n
\end{equation}
Suppose this is equal to 1.  Now \(x^j y\) has order
2 so a factor of \(y\) will be left in the result unless \(n\) is even. In the
case where \(n\) is even, \(\varphi_{ij}(x^m y^n) = x^{im}\), so \(im\) must be
divisible by 3, and since \(i\) is either 1 or 2, this implies \(m\) is
divisible by 3. Therefore, if \(\varphi_{ij}(g) = 1\) then \(g = 1\), that is,
each of the 6 \(\varphi_{ij}\)'s is an automorphism of \(S_3\), and there are
no other automorphisms.</p></li>

<p><span class="problem">Exercise 2.6.11</span> Since \(\{1, a\}\) is a normal
subgroup, for all \(g \in G\), \(gag^{-1} \in \{1, a\}\). But \(gag^{-1}\)
cannot be equal to 1 unless \(a = 1\), therefore \(gag^{-1} = a\) for all
\(g \in G\), that is, \(a\) is central.</p>
