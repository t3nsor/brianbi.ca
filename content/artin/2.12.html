<h2>Section 2.12. Quotient Groups</h2>
<p><span class="problem">Exercise 2.12.1</span> Suppose \(H\) is a subgroup of
\(G\) and that the product of two left cosets is always a left coset.
Suppose \(g \in G, h \in H\) and consider the cosets \(gH\) and \(g^{-1}H\).
Their product contains the identity, so it must be \(H\) itself; it also
contains \(ghg^{-1}h^{-1}\), which must therefore be in \(H\), implying that
\(ghg^{-1} \in H\) as well. Since this holds for all choices of \(g\) and
\(h\), we conclude that \(H\) is normal. This is the contrapositive to what we
wanted to prove.</p>
<p><span class="problem">Exercise 2.12.2</span> One can easily verify that
\(I \in H\), that the product of two upper triangular matrices is upper
triangular, and that
\begin{equation}
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; a &amp; b \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; c \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1
\end{bmatrix}^{-1} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; -a &amp; ac-b \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; -c \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1
\end{bmatrix} \label{eqn:e1}
\end{equation}
establishing that \(H\) is a subgroup of \(GL_3(\mathbb{R})\). Obviously
\(K\) is a subset of \(H\) containing the identity, and elements of \(K\) can
be multiplied by adding the upper-right elements together, implying that \(K\)
satisfies the conditions to be a subgroup of \(H\). Note that multiplication
between elements of \(K\) and elements of \(H\) is given by
\begin{align*}
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; x \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; a &amp; b \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; c \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1
\end{bmatrix} &amp;=
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; a &amp; b + x \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; c \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1
\end{bmatrix} \\
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; a &amp; b \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; c \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; x \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1
\end{bmatrix} &amp;=
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; a &amp; x + b \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; c \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1
\end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}
therefore \(K\) is contained in the centre of \(H\), implying that \(K\) is a
normal subgroup of \(H\). Moreover, let \(h \in H\); then the coset \(hK\)
consists of precisely those elements of \(H\) that are equal to \(h\) at the
12 and 23 entries. Call this coset \(C_{ac}\) where \(a = h_{12}\) and
\(c = h_{23}\). To see how these cosets behave under multiplication, we
compute the product of two arbitrary elements:
\begin{equation}
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; a &amp; b \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; c \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; d &amp; e \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; f \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1
\end{bmatrix} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; d+a &amp; e+af+b \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; f + c \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1
\end{bmatrix} \label{eqn:e2}
\end{equation}
so the product of the cosets \(C_{ac}\) and \(C_{df}\) is \(C_{d+a,f+c}\);
so the quotient group \(H/K\) is isomorphic to \(\mathbb{R}^+ \times
\mathbb{R}^+\). Using \((\ref{eqn:e2})\) we can also see that multiplication
in the opposite order yields the same matrix but with \(ce\) in place of
\(af\), therefore the two matrices commute iff \(af = cd\). If either \(a\) or
\(c\) is nonzero, it is always possible to choose \(f\) and \(d\) such that
\(af \neq cd\), therefore the centre of \(H\) is precisely \(K\).</p>
<p><span class="problem">Exercise 2.12.3</span> For each \(g \in G\), write
\(P_g\) for the equivalence class of \(g\) (that is, the element of the
partition \(P\) that contains \(g\)). We are given that \(N = P_1\). Another
useful fact is that for any \(a, b \in G\), the product \(P_a P_b\) is
contained within \(P_{ab}\). (Since \(ab \in P_a P_b\) and the RHS is contained
within some set of \(P\), the latter must be the unique element of \(P\) that
contains \(ab\), namely \(P_{ab}\).)</p>
<p>We are given that \(1 \in N\). For all \(n \in N\), we have
\(P_{n^{-1}}P_n \subseteq P_1\). But \(P_{n^{-1}}P_n\) also contains
\(n^{-1}1\) since \(1 \in P_n\). Therefore \(n^{-1} \in P_1 = N\).
So \(N\) is closed under inverses.</p>
<p>Also, \(P_1 P_1 \subseteq P_1\), but \(N = P_1\), so \(NN \subseteq N\),
that is, \(N\) is closed under the operation of \(G\). So \(N\) is a subgroup
of \(G\).</p>
<p>Moreover, for all \(g \in G\), we have \(gNg^{-1} \subseteq
P_g P_1 P_{g^{-1}} \subseteq P_1 = N\). So \(N\) is a normal subgroup of
\(G\).</p>
<p>Take \(a \in G\); then \(aN \subseteq P_a P_1 \subseteq P_a\). Also,
\(a^{-1} P_a \subseteq P_{a^{-1}} P_a \subseteq P_1 = N\), therefore
\(P_a \subseteq aN\). Taken together, these results imply that \(aN = P_a\).
Thus, each coset of \(N\) exactly coincides with one of
the elements of \(P\), and since the cosets cover \(G\), there are no
elements of \(P\) that are not cosets of \(N\).</p>
<p><span class="problem">Exercise 2.12.4</span> The coset \(zH\) consists of
the four complex numbers \(\{z, iz, -z, -iz\}\). On the complex plane, these
are four points with the same distance from the origin, spaced out evenly on
the circumference of the circle. We claim that an isomorphism between \(G\) and
\(G/H\) is given by \(\varphi(re^{i\theta}) = [re^{i\theta/4}]\).</p>
<p> First, we need to check
that this is well-defined. If \(z = re^{i\theta} = r'e^{i\theta'}\), then
\(r' = r\) and \(\theta' - \theta = 2\pi i n\) for some \(n \in \mathbb{Z}\).
In that case, \(re^{i\theta'/4} = e^{2\pi i n/4} re^{i\theta/4}\), but
\(e^{2\pi i n/4} \in H\), so \([re^{i\theta'/4}] = [re^{i\theta/4}]\). So
\(\varphi\) is indeed well-defined.</p>
<p>Now let \(z = re^{i\theta}, z' =
r'e^{i\theta'}\). Then \(\varphi(zz') = \varphi(rr' e^{i(\theta + \theta')})
= [rr' e^{i(\theta + \theta')/4}]\), and \(\varphi(z)\varphi(z') =
[re^{i\theta/4}][r'e^{i\theta'/4}]\); this latter coset is easily seen to
contain the element \(rr'e^{i(\theta + \theta')/4}\), so it is the same coset
as \(\varphi(zz')\).  Therefore \(\varphi\) is a homomorphism.</p>
<p>Finally,
suppose \(\varphi(re^{i\theta}) = [1]\). Then \([re^{i\theta/4}] = [1]\),
implying \(re^{i\theta/4} = e^{2\pi i n/4}\) for some \(n \in \mathbb{Z}\),
implying \(r = 1\) and \(\theta/4 - 2\pi n/4 = 2\pi m\) for some
\(m \in \mathbb{Z}\), so \(\theta\) is an integer multiple of \(2\pi\) and
\(re^{i\theta} = 1\). That is, the kernel of \(\varphi\) is trivial;
\(\varphi\) is an isomorphism as we claimed.</p>
