<div style="margin: 1em">I majored in physics and chemistry (BSc 2014). When I
started in 2011, I liked chemistry a lot and physics was mostly an
afterthought, but in the three years I spent in that program, I came to like
physics more and chemistry less.  By my last year of college I was frequently
reading about even more physics in my spare time, and also writing lots of
answers about physics on Quora. You can find some of my answers mirrored
here.
